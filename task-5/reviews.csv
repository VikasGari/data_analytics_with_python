"Its Awesome... Good sound quality & 8-9 hrs battery life... Just waww look... 😉 I brought just 999 rupees...But Amazon's Packageing system is Very bad... Very poor packaging... Flipcart's packaging system is much better than Amazon...

"Sound-4.5/5Build quality-4.5/5Battery life -4/5Earphones quality is good with strong magnetic lock... Straps is good quality and the earphones wires are too good... Buttons quality is good.. sound is full of punchy bass and and balanced treble and has sorrund effect.. good fitting in ears.. hope connectivity is good.. bcz my last boat Bluetooth bassheads 225 had connection issues... This is worth its price... Hope the packaging was good ...there was no bubble wrapping..

"I can’t get enough of this earphone! The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. The fact that I can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better. I use my earphones a lot for voice calls and this doesn’t let me down at all.  This is a must buy for all music lovers.

"The sound quality is good. I mean it can’t be compared with Senheiser or Bose but its worth the price.Perfect to use while running; the earbuds are so comfortable that you wouldn’t even feel they are plugged in.

"Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

"The product is great intially !But the real test is after 2 months of useSo reviewing the product after two months of usePros1 The earphones drives you a very rich sound quality inspite of being wireless2 The neck band makes it much more durable then the other earphones3 The flat wire is very durable and the magnets saves it from you loosing it4 The 45 degree tilted earbuds just fits right in most of the ears (you can check with other 45 degree tilted earphones for a day that weather you are comfortable with it or not )5 It comes with 2 pairs of extra buds the small and big while the medium one is already on itCons1 - The connectivity of dual phones is not that easy as shown.(>Connect the earphone to phone A as usual>Disconnect it from the phone A by switching off the Bluetooth on phone A>Now connect the earphone to phone B>Switch off the earphone and switch it on back>Open the Bluetooth settings on phone A and B>From the paired device list select boAt rockers 255 on both the device at the same time.On the earphones you will get to hear YOU ARE NOW CONNECTED TO BOAT ROCKERZ 255 TWICE )2- You get a cracking sound when ideal or just before you dial a number on dial pad3 - Battery life is not accurateSometimes it work hours with 40-60 % battery while sometime it is dead on 80%So Dont rely on the battery indicator  at all but the battery once charged for 2-3 hours works constantly for 5-6 hours on normal volume.I hope this was of some help do mark it helpful  if so...Overall you should go for it when you get a exciting deal on this product

"I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more.I will say,Go for it.

"Although sound quality is good, but then whats a purpose of buying a wireless earphone when its controls (buttons) doesn't work. I bought this product withing a week controls where stop responding cant switch on or do anything.replaced it got refund bought another piece different color that worn out in a day.Both the time seller was "" Appario Retail Private Ltd"". So i leave it to your wisdom whether you want to buy this or not. I will never buy this brand at least from this platform.

"I am a prime customer of Amazon and I always purchase a product after so much research bought these boat rokerz in the sale in 1099 and trust me I am blown away by these I have used sony and other headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range ""sound quality"" 10/10 ""battery life"" seems good not tested for as described but will update soon ""durability"" 10/10 perfect fit no pain no discomfort.... Really boat has done a fantastic job with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... Just go for it.

Big Suggestion DO NOT BUY THIS

"Awesome bass. This is even at low volume. So if bass is your thing these are the earphones for you. Really like the sound. There could be more clarity but nonetheless these are good.Great battery life as well. Lasts about 5-6 hours.The only grouse is that they are not very comfortable. I changed the plugs to the smallest but my ears still hurt. Maybe just takes getting used to.Spent 999 for it on the great Indian sale. Definitely worth it.

"Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• The sound is nothing great, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• Battery life is nothing to write home about – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!

"The headphones were good at the beginning but after a week getting disturbance on left side earpiece which stays for sometime
",negative
"Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It's durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.

"Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.

"The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product.
",negative
"Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.
",negative
"Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

"I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

"Product design is good and very durable. The best feature is the sound quality and its design. However what i didn't liked is the battery backup. Its up hardly for 3 to 4 hrs if continuously powered on which requires to be charged atleast 2x a day. Overall I would say , its a good deal only if its under 1K or max 1.2K inr.. otherwise I wont recommend it.

"** the product was a perfect purchase... but it is not charging, requested for replacement..Replacement is quick and so prominent... Thank You boAt team...Pros:•Soft feeling wearing this ""boAT Rockerze"" and look also good..•The sound quality is excellent, it's like a premium brands...•I am using just after receiving the product without charging and it is going on and on. The battery lasts for full 2days. Am so happy.•Value for money.Cons:-Not find still now...

"Pros:charge time 2 hrs and backup is very good full day use (6 hr continuous)two led colors red and blue . while using blue light blinks after every few secs,in-build ringtone (trrrin trrrin type).using in honor 6x show battery icon in 100-80-50-25-0 stages.Gives warning on low battery and when connected or disconnected (human voice).Lightwight,good build quality.i replaced rubber earplugs with piston earphone plugs, the 3 pairs comes with package are not too soft but are fine.you can control volume of pc and mobile depends on which device is currently playing.i am using piston onemore ,music quality is not to that level but is pretty decent. bass is balancedcons:Range is 10m in real world plays well if u are in room , the moment you walk out of room then distortion occurs.mic is very sensitive and works fine so far no complains from other end. i have not used outside the room.when it keep it for charging it gets switch off on it own then have to reconnect it again (not a big issue) ....first i had doubt on it battery,sound quality,mic quality but after using it i am happy even though i have used one more ,boat 255,mi earphone 399 , Samsung earphone, Phillips 249 etc.
I have already used boat earphone and was quite satisfied with the performance interms of sound and bass, however I didn't expect that much this boat rockers 255 is tremendously performing great sound, clearance, noice cancellation bass will never gonna feel you headache and all if I talk about battery it works 7 Hours a day continuesly...well fitted in ear without any pain got this deal at lightning price at 999.Thanks Amazon to provide such deal and swift delivery and your faith!!!

"I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

"Nice product. I love it's sound and bass. I purchased for me and another two for my family members after I make sure for it's sound quality. But one thing I really concerned here about it build quality. Mine replaced for two times till now for it's power button issue. It will take 20 days to replace the product. First time after 20 days of purchaseing and then after three months. Now they clame this new replacement is a good one. Let's see how many days it will again goes.

"Well i used boat products before they are good as they were before.pros - base is good , water resistant ( here doscription says IPx4 but my earphone box says IPx5, and that is even better , you should update your product description. ) , Magnet lock , design .Con - cable is a bit long. As it has control box both side and a little hard cable at back, the remaining cable shouldn't be this long.Above all its a good product. Recommend to all the people who wants to buy a cheap but best wireless earphone.

"I am pleased to write a review and i will talk both about pros and cons:Pros:1. Good Bass2. Sturdy3. Great look4. Good noise cancellationCons:1. Forget buying this if you are planning to use it for gaming like battle royale games, There is an issue with the latency or bluetooth lag, You will hear the noise 3 seconds after you fire the gun.2. Disspointed battery backup, max is 1 or 1.5. hours if you continously use it at low volume.3. Wrong place where the charging port is installed, difficult to plugin or plug out.

"Really like the base and sound quality for this price. It's good to listen to music. I have a Bose 300 QC but I'm using this on a day to day basis as carrying QC wherever I go is not practical. I going this headphone is  quite enough for my music need . The microphone is working as expected.The only issue is that the headphone doesnt announce the battery percentage. However my OnePlus 6t shows headphone battery when connected. The headphone give the annoying message ""battery is low"" from 20% onwards.

"I had brought the piece after reading lot of reviews etc. when i purchased and started using it turned off and said battery low .. Thats fine as initial product charged battery full and started using it ..It started reconnecting most of time and sound started disappearing . I checking the range on the manual which said 10m and i saw when i placed my mobile in shirts pocket it was perfect and working and when i moved it to pants pocket it disconnected and reconnected . and it kept happening with 100% charge and was totally waste of time and value for this .Tried many times and got to know its very small range one and doesnt come with proper range.

"Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH

"Just got this and I must say that the build quality is great. Coming to the sound it has really good bass. Can't comment of the battery yet as I just got it. I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage.

"The headphones are good, however the first one broke within one month, and boat replaced it, so kudos. Battery life is enough for one and half of my gym sessions, so I'd say between 5-6 hrs. Sound is clear with good depth.

"I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.

"In terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. Sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine.

"The bass and sound clearity is just awesome..very comfortable...call quality is also awesome...but the battery seems not ok.I got the product delivered yesterday after unboxing the product I noticed that the battery was 100% I have continuously used it for like 2-3 hours and the battery % came down to 80% again I have used it for like 2hours and the battery was still 80%.Day 2,In the morning I used it again for like 30 minutes suprisingly the battery was still 80% I was just amazed.Later I dint use it till the evening.Later on at 7 I used it continuously till 9 pm and yes the battery was still 80%.Here the real problem occurs after the my dinner I was relaxing in the balcony and was on a phone call suddenly I started getting beep sounds from my new boat 255 earphones and the I checked the battery% it was 20% I was like whaaattttt!! seriously!! Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That's all for now amigos.

"The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

"Better in price range of 1399 best for use microphone quality is like wired headphone not only good for hearing music but also for talking with ur love ones at night.. best in all ur budget is under 1500 if ur budget is 4000 then go true wireless but in that u will miss the microphone quality u have to speak louder good for daily use bass is not best but okay type in this price range of wireless headphone neon and black colour is good all the three colours look awesome noise cancellation is not that much it fit properly u can use for gym heavy workout but due to neckband its little heavier and feeling of wired around neck as this is Bluetooth headset then not that much long lasting coz u have to charge the battery and one day after one year may the battery get damaged don't charge is frequently once its less than 20% than only charge this headphone battery backup of continues use in starting is 4 to 5hrs and at standby mode u can use it for 2days.. once u get this u will forget ur phone as whenever call will come u Don't have to run just use ur connected headset to receive the call .

"Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 KJust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.Talking about build quality, sound clarity and looksI personally liked it.. Bass is really good no noise while hearing. If you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. Look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..I use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won't get dropped off.Battery is ok I am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge. Battery capacity could have been increased at least to 10 hrs by Boat. But no worries...

"Bought this 4 months back.Pros- good sound, nice battery back, very light on neck.  Good only for listening to musicCons - really bad for using it for its actual purpose.

"Can't compare with sony or any other branded ones. But in this price it's good. Silicon material good to wear no feeling of like we are carrying it on our neck . Its comfortable having it around the neck due to good silicon material.  As this is in ear canal type speakers we. Eed to really push it inside the canal 1st 1/3.then only we can enjoy real beats and bass. If you wear it superficially sound won't look great. So far battery , durability,sound ,price this is best one.

"I’ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.

"Boat rockerz BT headphone.1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good. Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on.

"I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!

"I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

"Honestly First bummer was packaging.It looks like it was already opened.The package got little torn.. tape looks off the place. Also, earphones inside also didn't looked like fresh packaging. It really looks like It was used before.but I could be wrong and it could be just bad packaging also.sound is good though , average loud, but not very good. Range is good i can easily use it while moving in my house. You will always feel some disturbance while playing.Also, I tried connecting with multiple devices but it can not be done while it's connected to other device. First, you gotta disconnect it then it can be connected.

"after 3 days of use I am writing this review.. I have got it at Rs. 999.001) battery life almost 5 hours of music.  not a problem for me.2) built up quality good.3) most importantly sound quality not awesome. may be good. if u like bass a great then good choice but vocal sound is seemed lower and sometimes not crystal clear. I have senheiser cx180 which costs rs.750. produces much crisp sound and bass.but overall at rs. 999 it is a good deal.

"Amazon packaging : Not up to the mark, only comes in a plastic ploybag which is the outer bag, no internal protection per se!Durability : looks sturdy, package also says sweat resistant, only delicate part is the charging port flap :PSound : it rockss!! Bass as well as treblesOne good thing is it wont let you increase the sound beyond a threshold via headphones ( u can do it from phone :P)Noice cancellation is awesome.Felt slightly more protruding, needs to be inserted deep into ear👂 otherwise chances of falling down ( not on the ground btw)Package contains : charging cable 10-15 cm long, 2 pairs of buds of different sizes, warranty card + manualColour : red + black matt finish.Its post delivery feedback so no idea of battery backup, charging, sweat proof.

"I’ve been lately using a lot of products from boat !This product was on offer so thought of ordering the same.I was using base heads 225 beforeWhen compared directly to them this earphone is not that great in terms of base but !!!! The earphone is wireless which takes away all the things !It’s quiet light weight ! And the price is just awesome for the same. The earphone is very easy to connect and it’s quiet reliable too! One can wear whole day and won’t even feel them. The sound quality is more over on the base side. If you are someone who love good base then this is for you !Do give it a try and this product won’t disappoint you !The service of boat is way ahead then other brands

"I purchased it one month back after comparing it with so many products. But to my surprise noice cancellation , bass and sound quality of the product is just amazing. Even compared with JBL LIVE200BT which costs around 4200 , this headphone is far better than JBL one.just go for it if you want to have a good wireless headphones in this price range.Only Con i came across is the battery indicator is not working properly it suddenly jumps from 40 percent to low battery but actual battery life is as claimed around 6-7 hours

"Just unpacked and pairing was very easy. I was able to pair this to my OnePlus 5T and Laptop. After pairing my phone first, I switched off the bluetooh in phone and paired with my PC. Then switched on the bluetooth in phone. Played music from PC and when I received a call in my phone, the headset goes silent and the music automatically pauses. Exactly the way I wanted. However, one drawback is that when the phone call ends, the music doesnt resume automatically.Sound Quality is good.Good bass.Comfortable to wear

"Dont go for this product. I have seen the reviews and purchased it but to my surprise, the ear phones are very bad at producing the decent bass,instead the bass is too heavy that even a bass head like me does not find it good. Too heavy to use it for longer times, u might end up hurting ur ears.

"Let me tell you that don't buy this. Yes it's true that it's the best product you can get for the price (I doubt that) but definitely it's not the best product YOU should buy.Problems faced:1. Battery is pathetic. Mostly gives 3 hours of playtime2. The earphones get disconnected if you even go to the next room3. Sound is too low. I have to use 3rd party Equalizer to listen clearly4. The bass is also not good. Have to rely on the 3rd party appsThe only thing is Boat has a very good warranty service but the problems with the device make it a garbage af

"This is a good buy. Sits comfortably around the neck, earpiece is good, and feels sturdy.Noise cancellation is surprisingly good at this price range (during phone calls person on the other end hears very less background noise.)Sound quality - good with Android. With iPhone the sound tends to get crackling at high volumes when equaliser is on. No complains on flat sound.Wires are a bit long, but you get used to it after a while.My only issue with this and other BT earphones in this price bracket is with the voice breaking. If I keep my phone in my pocket (jeans) and walk the audio starts to break and I have to reposition the neckband. This has happened quite a number of times. I used to own a Tagg inferno and MiVi thunderbeats, both had this issue and this one too.To summarise, worth buying, if under 1500.

"I am really glad of having this product. The previous one from boat was boat rockerz 400 whose sound quality with bass was just fabulous but call quality dissapointed me but this one really is excellent... I think i made the right choice of having this great product. Really awsome product with best call quality , best durability, an excellent sound quality and a decent battery backup. What else one need from a product ranging around 1-1.5 k.. Really i just loved it

"Product received on time there is no issue.  Sharing my experience here for you to decide before you go for this product only.During calls suddenly it goes blank.There is no noise cancellation or its not working properly.  Always people on call ask me ""are you outside, we are getting so many noise""I have ordered replacement, after 15 days i received serviced item (may be before that someone used and returned to boat), Same issue persist but now I don't know what to do... and I am not using this for important office calls.  Just using for hearing music & watching movies.  Replacement process is good, they only come and collect your product and return using courier, if you raise ticket online.  Problem rectified or not that's matter.Overall my suggestion / experience I could say ""Don't go for this product if you really want to use it for official purpose""

"Got these in sale and very disappointed. I had earlier JBL wireless headphones and they were of very good quality then I lost them. Saw ad of these wireless headphones in newspaper and decided to buy as I already use Boat 400 which are awesome but I got disappointed with these, I have to speak very loudly in order for my voice to reach the other party (which looks very weird in public) and I feel that quality is also not upto the mark. Amazon I feel knew about this and thats why these were on sale and non returnable.I am now stuck with them and I DO NOT recommend that you buy these at all.Thanks.

"<Pros>* Rich bass* Good built quality* Magnetic lock* Nice grip over neck*Good company service (had to replace it because of faulty charging)<Cons/>*Dont leave the charging cap open because sweat can get in through it and damage the charging...*Detailed review*Boat Rockerz 255 bluetooth in-ear headset is a very good quality product. It has a very rich bass and nooce cancellation is also pretty good. Accessories like ear buds of different sizes and charging cable are provided. If you workout and sweat alot then make sure to keep tha charging cap closed because if sweat goes through it then it may damage the charging, the charging stopped working after 2 weeks so i had to replace it..and the company service was amazing it took around 10 days and then i got a replaced piece back with extra accessories..*Conclusion*I would really recomend this, this headset provide a very good value for money.PS- Just dont walk while using it..because the noice cancellation will not let u hear anything else and it may cause an accident..

"I love these Earphones.My battery lasted from morning 6:40 am to 11pm where it was continuously connected to my smartphone. I used it for calls and for1 hour for music in this time period.There's a lot of Bass. This can be levelled with your smart phone's inbuilt equalizer, but it will be a pain if you are using multiple music players or video players.The build quality is good w.r.t. the price. I bought it for Rs. 1399/-.Bluetooth pairing is very fast. No hazzles.It can be used for all activities but not voice recording. So if anyone is looking out for recording audio with this device then this is not at all what you are looking for.

"Eventhough it connects two divices at the same time, however audio doesn't switch to the first device connected.  While playing the audio from the first device connected, it doesn't work. Only it works for last device connected. We need to reconnect the previous device to get it works.Not sure manufacturing defect or functionality limitation.  Atleast it works flawlessly for other bluetooth headset like Jabra.ANyway it's light weight and sound quality is better than many other product of same price range

"I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones to use during my gym workouts and I found these for Rs. 999 during a sale event. Here's my review after 1 week of using this product -Pros:1) Excellent bass quality. You'll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.Cons:Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery leftEar pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usageMic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.Overall it's a good buy for the price range.

"I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.

"Great headset for music lovers. Solid bass, loud volumes and volume control separate for the headset in addition to mobile volume control which is a huge plus. Good sound quality on audio calls. Did not try while jogging, so unabl to review the moisture wicking properties much. Good length to the earphone cable and good battery life. I purchased it for 949 INR and h nice good VFM. Overall I would buy again.Design wise, I like the Boult wireless better than this as the wire tends to hang long down your neck when you are not using the earphones  Otherwise a great product to buy!

"I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty.

"Sound quality isn't that good. Not worth the cost. Durability, well it comes with a plastic construction, that you need to wear around neck. So can't fit it in anything.Feeling bad buying this product considering the image doesn't clarify the plastic ring around the neck. Oh yes one more thing Ear piece has rubber hook on it but design is so bad that you can't get it in ears properly.

"The product design is really good, comfortable, lightweight. The color combination is perfect for the unisex collection. I picked a red and black combination. The noise cancellation for the call is good but not up to the mark. The biggest drawback I felt was I could not connect to my laptop via Bluetooth plus you cannot take calls from the headset. the buttons are to control the volume and play and pause the call.

"For the price it is offered I would recommend this . Noise cancellation is surprisingly good . Sound quality is also impressive but not the greatest for sure . Bass effect is more . Fit the ear perfectly and doesn't come off . Wire and exteriors are made of plastic but serves the primary purpose .

Really unhappy about having to spend 500 extra! Quality wise they're good but not exceptional. Also the eartips hooks are smaller than other branded earphones so not interchangeable with other earphones! I find it very inconvenient because my Sennheiser earphones have much better quality tips which I cannot fit on these as they fit lose.

"One of the best boAt earphones. I have been using boAt for two years and I found their services to be very very impressive. The audio quality is very good. The music feels amazing. Bass is also good compared to other boAt products.However, one problem is that there is latency in audio while you are playing a game. I played PUBG using these earphones and there was a mismatch between audio and the action performed in the game. If you are a gaming freak and plays a lot of game such as PUBG, Asphalt, COD, or any other game where audio is everything then don't buy bluetooth devices. Go for wired one, they will perform far better. Hope you will find this review helpful!

"Battery life is good but not that great, expecting bit more for this price.Sound quality nicely clear, loud and no distortion at moderate volume.Durability is good but product looks somewhat delicate so I am not sure it can handle some rough usage.Wearing comfort is good, connecting process with phone is very easy and fast.

"I bought one recently and below was my experience :1) the wireless range is very low.2) battery life isn't good either.3) boat is known for it's bass, but this one's bass was terribly unpleasant.Final verdict : Don't buy it. Better go for Mi sports basic headsets that 's much better and has a balanced sound. Or if you have a good budget, go with the Jays t-Four or RHA, they are just WOW!!

"Economic is what I would say. Not great nor too bad. It's decent with performance and battery life. You can surely go for it if u not a music freak and need sound quality of high standards. A really good product for day to day use. I would say for this price - the justice has been done.

"I had bought the earphones about 20 days back. They were working absolutely fine. They fit perfectly and sound great.But after 20 days of working they stopped working. They wont switch on. I tried charging with powerbanks, PC, chargers (I was very careful of not exceeding the amperage for charging and I didnt exceed the limit). Now to claim warranty I have to send this to the company which will take at least 10-15 days. This is very unfortunate and I am seriously questioning the legitimacy of this brand.

"Good build quality at this price range. Sound quality is good but a little improvement will be appreciated. No battery indicatiin. No full charge indication. No option to change the male notificatiin voice to female notification voice. Glitches are too often. Battery level indication in connected phone is wrong, shows 100% and 80% then direct 20% 4 to 5 minutes before shutting down.

"Great product. Got it for a price of 999 only.Range- As mentioned in product descriptionSound- Quality is good unless you are a die hard music lover or music creator.Might hurt your ears on extensive use.Good for rough use.Battery life-6hrs(verified)I personally use it for working out, watching movies and listening to songs.Great value for money .

"Impressed with this product. This one has got a lot of BAAAAAASSSSS. So if you like to burn your ears for some beats. Go for it!Battery back up is decent. 6 hours in high volume)(not recommended) and 10 hours for a decent level volume and sometimes more than 10 hrs 😊Grip is really nice. Sticks to ears properly. The charger that we get along with the headset is a nice product. Chargers quickly in about 20 mins charge for 3 hrs playback time. Cooooool isn't??? 💪Thank you Boat alias Nirvana!

"Still struggling to get through the customer care of Boat! Which is virtually non existent. Whenever I get to talk to their customer support all they do is promise that they are working on it and never get back. I would recommend to go for products which has a decent after sales service. Boat is proving to be the typical use and throw China product!

"I am using this headset for more than 6 months. Purchased for ₹1500. Sound quality, Base everything is good for this price.Charging time: 2 - 3 hours normal charging (Not tried turbo / Fast charging).Working time: 6 - 7 hours, of music & phone calls.For music: smooth and clear sound quality. Volume increase and decrease buttons available.For phone calls: Good, i didn't found anything bad.Wearing: I am using it for running, Gym, driving (Able to wear inside helmet).Connectivity: Bluetooth, automatically switch off when device not connected (within 5min)

"First of all, for 999 it's the best.So I'm reviewing this as a 13-1500 rs device.After 3 months of usage-Soung quality is very good for the price.Bass is also very good.Range is 'decent'.You'll become used to in 2-3 days of usage it's comfortable (it's light as )Connectivity and usability is also very easy.Mic will work well most of the time, just ensure it's at the right place.But one thing I'd say you after 3 months of usage that build quality us 'above average' that's all, especially you have to be very careful with the wires.

"Actually a product worth buying.. I have mostly been a fan of quality products than brand names.. Boat has come up with a product that does just everything it is supposed to do.. I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that's why it's even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!

"Firstly the voice quality of the product is very nice compared to others at this range, however the service from boat side is not right. Mu product was damaged at the 7th day and I initiated the replacement option, the reverse pick up was scheduled however no delivery information is available still. Itz being 3 days now, when you go to boat website the tracking status button does not works on the website and even you cannot reach an representative via call. I don't know if I am gonna receive the product back or not!

"Writing after 1 months of rough use .Only get detached the rubber cap of charging point.Super compatible with my Samsung Grand 2 , Samsung M20 and Lenovo Lappy.Light weight.Super sound quality.  Same as JBL as I am JBL freak . Now a days JBL is giving bad cord for headphones... this one is good in 255.Only problem is the distance frequency is very very low.I purchased on Rs.999/- on sale.Better than other products as the round neck is not stiff so can listen while sleep too .Don't think too much just go for it .. not disappoint you .

"Very happy with the product. Been using it for last one month. Pairing in seconds. Sound quality is pretty good. I mostly use it for listening to music from Spotify/ Gaana. It comes with 3 different sizes of plug. I changed to small one which fits well in my ears. The legs are rubbery and very flexible so sits in the ear properly. Go for it!!

"Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.

"Didnt fit my expectations,sound quality is good but battery backup is pathetic never lasted more than half an hour on 100 % charge,moreover the range too isnt good.doesnt work for running as the fitting isnt great .packaging too was pathetic it had dust inside the package.Stopped working within two weeks,wareanty isnt smooth too,jun 14 se complaint daali hai no response.wasted my money

"Above expectation, excellent sound quality and the battery life is just incredible, one charge easily lasts you around mote than 5 days with normal uses (only music while traveling) and 6-8 hrs in one go if you using it continuously. The durability is nice and the magnetic feature really comes handy when not in use. Light weight very negligible weight and not noticeable when around neck, but sometimes this may result of loosing it and not suitable for bike ride (if riding at high speed).

"Please don't buy this product. Only after using for 1 month earphones had stopped working and got it replaced within 15 days time. Now again I'm facing same issue with the replaced one.Had bought this earphones for jogging especially for jogging purpose however the keys don't work and I'm not sure of these are even sweat proof. Purchased in the month of March'19 now facing a lot of issues as to charging, battery life, Bluetooth connectivity, ear placement.

"The audio quality is just amazing!! Powerful bass and crystal clear audio. I haven't tested the battery's capacity though....but it took me around 1 hour to bring down the battery from 100% to about 85% at 70% of volume. So it seems the battery can easily last for 5 hours. Overall, it is an amazing earphone at this price range with excellent audio quality and noise cancellation.

"Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.

"Damaged Product and Packaging.Though this item was packed in another bigger carton box with air bubble cushioning and few other items, this particular item was damaged and the deal was open already.Thought, at least the product should do well, but the product failed to take charge and power up, which clearly indicated the product was a formerly returned item due to malfunction. Rather going to manufacturer warranty and repair/retirement this got resold.I've had many ear phones from BoAt and really love this brand (in the wireless category) alternating to House of Marley (in the wired category). But this one was shear disappointment.

"Sound Qualitywhomever used boat 225 in-ears headphones can understand better. If you have both 225 nd rockerz 255, you can compare the sound quality at the high volume and the clarity of songs. 225 was far better in that..And the guidelines are there only for how to switch on the Bluetooth and not clear for how to switch it off.DistanceIt was surely dislike for any one, if your mobile was in the next room then it was disconnecting again.ChargingDraining fast for continues usage, need to charge it more times. And it was not showing clearly indication of charging bar in mobile. Showing it rarely.Light IndicationIt was not clear at all. It is showing a mixed colours.MicWithout holding it you can't talk properly. It was a dear distance to use.And if you continuously keep them in ears it will be paining.Please never don't buy it from Appario seller. Better to buy from another seller. Even we can't return the product for lifetime..

"PROSmaterial quality is GOOD.sound quality is great.Durable Enough.earpieces are good. Earpieces Fit properly in ears.The microphone works fine.Bluetooth connectivity is Good. Connects with both PC and MOBILE very easily.Voice Acknowledgements are great in this Earphone. ( for  switch ON,  Switch OFF  &  Connectivity)There is a small light Indicator on the Earphone that works fine.We can charge the Earphone through adaptor or USB.CONSAs it is a Bluetooth Earphone, therefore, it works great within a certain range. Try not to go too far from your Device(Mobile  or PC )While Commuting If the volume is too high, The earphone cancels all the noise around us. This can be dangerous.Overall this product is great  . Whether you are using it for Voice or Video calls or listening to music (soft or high bass) or listening to any video lecture.

"I read most of the review's before buying this earphones and i ended up buying this amazing boat rockerzz, the sound clearity is okayish but oh man, the bass, it's amazing and the connectivity is brilliant, i walk from one room to another without taking my phone and it works flawlessly Without any glitch.The problem in most of the bluetooth earphone is you have to press and hold the power button for almost 3 second to turn it on and the same for turning it off or shuffling between songs which is annoying.Wire postioning is good but it can be better.The battery almost lasts for about 3 days if you use it fot 2 to 3 hours a day and the ear hooks are excellent for outdoor activities with this earphone.After all with my personal experience i can tell everyone that you can but this phone bluetooth earphone if you want good sound clearity, amazing bass, a decent battery life, and comfortable to use.

"To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise.

"I have been using this product since early feb and it still works like a peach. The sound quality is brilliant. Never experienced a break in the Bluetooth sync. No sound delay while watching videos and the battery life is excellent too.. I just have one complaint, well actually its faced by the people who i talk to over the phone. Whenever I use this product to talk over the phone, they always complain about too much background disturbance. It does not cancel out the background sound of others talking around you. Rather their voices gets amplified and I have to immediately stop using it. I validated this by being on the receiving end and the complains definitely is genuine. I think this is the only issue which restricts it from being the ultimate product.

"Pros: 1.light weight, 2.fast pairing for BT, 3.Comfortable fit,4.Thundering bass!! Good for bass lovers.5.Google assistant works perfectly.Cons: 1.No vibration for call alert,hence can miss a call if phone is away.2. Due to extreme Bass, sometimes vocals and fine instrument sounds get masked.3. At full volumes, bass is very loud which if listened for long time can cause ear and headache.But there is a solution to the problem, you can install '' Black player'', which has tones of equaliser settings.So recommend people to use it and obviously go for boat rockerz 255, as it is value for money product!!! 😃

"I have both boat wired headsets and sound magic. Both of them have rich bass. I love them totally & am using from past few years.This wireless in-ear headsets doesn't have the richness in bass. May be the quality is compromised somewhere between the wired & wireless.Except for this one drawback, this product is bang for the bucks you pay. It's lightweight, comfortable, long playtime and the offer price of 999 is excellent.If you're okay with decent bass, this is for you.Apparao retail seller is doing a great job regarding offers & return requests.

"It is an awesome, I really like it cause the sound quality. And the most important thing is that it won't trouble your ears if you wear it for a long as I tried most of the headphones, wireless Bluetooths most of them troubles me a lot if I put them into or on my ears for a long like 1 to 2 hrs. But this one is really awesome, the bass is superb, it won't fall down from your ears while running... Amazing product. Boat rocker 255 is really rocking as the name..... If I want to rate it so definitely it will be 5/5

"In terms of sound quality, it is good. But this earphone is not for sports activity. The cable is quite heavy which will not let the earphone stick to your ear on heavy physical movement.Range is not even 5 meters. As soon as you cross thredistance you start getting interruption.Bluetooth quality is way poor that when you are walking listening music and have put your phone on your pocket, you start getting interruption.Wire is way to long. Around 2-3 inches extra, which looks weird if you are not putting it on and just kept it on neck. I have given the image. I am 5.4. The earphone is hanging 5 inches below my chest.Overall, bearable for walking, but definitely not good if you want to buy this for jogging or exercise.

"After 15 days of research I ordered this product. I got the neon one. The band is flexible and lightweight. I mostly use this while I go for cycling, on the first day, I just kept my mobile in the front basket of the cycle I was not able to hear any sound from the earphone. Later I moved my phone somewhat near to me then I'm able to hear songs. This is the first thing which I didn't like. Second thing was there is no noise cancellation, very poor noise cancellation. People on the other end of the call are able to hear everything from the background. They are not able to hear my voice properly, background noise was so clear that they disconnected my call telling that they're getting headache. After this incident I immediately returned the product. Usually I don't write reviews for anything, whether it's good or bad. But if I don't write many users will buy the product unknowingly. So do not go for this product. It is not good in any way. Leave about bass and all. There's is no noise cancellation and poor connectivity issues.

Must say boat has a very impressive online system which is efficient n responsive. The service centre took some time but i have received my earphones back hence the 5 star rating.

"Let me tell you this, I've used Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, Audio technika, JBL, Skullcandy, boAts and many tens of top and mid level brands. But I'm a fan of boAts for their Price - Satisfaction ratio and used many of their products and never was disappointed.Bought these earphones, I liked the build as soon as I saw them, loved the thumping bass when I tested it with multiple songs, loved the audio clarity too.And then an amazing thing happened.I was wearing them and was riding my motorcycle a bit faster and they blew away. An SUV drove over it. I thought I lost the earphones. But when I put the buds in my ear, songs were still playing as loud, as clear as ever.Button areas were damaged so badly but still, working perfect. I did not find any problem till now.

"It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...Pros :1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizesCons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.

However now whenever I plug this with any of my Bluetooth device, I hear screeching sound just like old days mobile network coverage sound.

"This was a product suggested by many but with my comprehensive use of over two months I can say it's not a good product. The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I'm listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones.

I'm using it for taking long calls and listening music..  It fulfil the purpose. Battery life is good and easy to charge.. This product is good for those who look for good blue tooth headset with decent cost.  No cons as such.. Even the ear bud n model is good to use..

"First impression is good. Sound quality is good. But the grip to hold earphones around your neck is quite light. Sometimes it gets fly away when you are driving. Battery life is good but after using it for 9 days i felt that when the battery is 60% and suddenly it gets down to 20 so fast and recently i was at 60% and suddenly the earphones gets off. After i got replacement, the new product seems to work very nice regarding the battery life but the noise cancellation was damn bad like you can't listen to the music while driving because the noise of the wind is too loud you cant even talk.. and hence i had to return the product..

"Absolutely poor quality sound, very low volume, lousy bass. I would have even ignored the sound but for the fact that the earphones just don't fit properly. Even with all the options given. These are only suitable for walking at a leisurely pace for those who are on a very tight budget. NOT recommended for running or jogging as the earbuds will keep popping out. I  returned the originals once thinking I had a defective piece but the replacement too had the same issue. Spend a little more and buy something better.

"When we Purchased it in April'2019. Used it for Two months now.....initially the bluetooth convenience in connecting two phone and sound quality made us happy......... but just in two months the volume has become very low... the sound quality has deteriorated ..... so we are  not satisfied . will not suggest anyone else to go for this product.

"Was good while it lasted.... three months down the line, one side earphones stopped working (no physical damage or misuse)... now I am trying to contact BOAT customer support for a replacement under warranty, but the support page on their website just does not load/exist...! Will update if and when I can get through to them...

"I bought this product in sale, so got it in very affordable prices.my first impression towards the wireless earphones are not so good, as it comes with some constraints in which battery issue is one of the major.but after purchasing this product my perception is completely change, this earphone has a very nice battery backup, I have used this earphones since last couple of months but still I have not facing any issue for use this product. also has a very nice build and durable quality.I recommend to all who wants to buy wireless earphone in affordable price.

"I like the build quality of this product and the battery life is awesome and while doing workout comfortness is good but I felt sound quality is not upto the mark while comparing out boat with wire  headsets like 225 only thing is the Boss is not that much good other than that awesome awesome product I got a good deal

"Headphones have servere connectivity issues  I use the Redmi note 4, the rockerz start having disturbance and voice starts breaking as soon as I keep my phone inside the pocket. Returned the product once 2nd one also had the same issue.Way of keeping them on the neck  with magnet is great.The noise cancellation is pretty good but at the same time is dangerous, it blocks out traffic noise totally.Audio is average, artificial bass dominates everything. Audio quality lacks basic details.Call quality was decent till the time there was no Bluetooth connection issues.Switched to tagg inferno, audio quality is much much better, connectivity problems are close to absent.

"These are a decent pair of earphones at the given price. I have earlier used the Skullcandy and the JBL earphones and compared them, this is not a disappointment at all.The sound quality, clarity and bass are quite good. The quality of voice, when using for phone calls, is pretty nice too.The battery lasts for little more than six hours on continuous use after a single charge.I would highly recommend these earphones.

"I am using it for quite a time now & i have to say it's the best one in this price segment. Sound Quality is outstanding with High Bass, it doesn't get wet even when i sweat a lot by running while wearing it. The noise cancellation could have been a little bit better, when on call the other person keeps telling me that background noises keeps on coming. Battery backup is awesome also, it remained on 100% even after playing videos & songs constantly for 3hrs. To sum it up, i have to say it is the best Bluetooth headset under 1500. You should really go for it.

"Actually I used it almost for 3 months where I feel it's better Time to reviewBattery back is awesome as mentionedBass is superSound quality is goodNoise cancellation is goodIt's also can be wearable when jogging or at the time of exercise there is no tension of falling from ears which I feel so betterFor these reasons I'm so satisfied with the product and costI bought it for Rs 1500/-

"I've bought this product. For the music lovers it is really 👌. It has good noice cancellation and the mic works great but the only drawback is that the music doesn't stops even though the ear buds are connected with their magents inbuoit in it. Apart from it the bass, noice cancellation, mic and the battery🔋 backup everything is good and it is affordable price.

"Using this headphones from 5-6 days and found below issues.1. Battery life is too poor, while using it shows 100% battery but while using battery drained out in 15-20 minutes2. Automatically disconnection of headphone while connected with phone.3. Ears are paining while using the headphones 1 hour or so.4. Battery discharge very quickly.5. While plugin to charge when its 0%, it started showing 100% charged in 15 minutes, that's a CRAP.I have now returned the product back to the seller and call for a replacement. So, its better to be move towards SONY, JBL or Sennheiser Headphones.

"I m writing this review after 1 month of usage. Product is no doubt a value for money, quality of material is decent, battery life is around 6-8 hours. I mostly use it for office calls n response is absolutely marvelous. Earplug wires r pretty long comparative to other neck bands. Bass is good and overall a must buy in this range.

"it has  extreme bass and a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity. It has a mindblowing battery which gives 7-8 hrs music playback time . It's mic is also good & you will not be  disappointed with the voice quality. But more than putting 2 hrs it feels very uncomfortable to me bcz of its conical buds(can be removed). It's Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in looking.It's long wires really disappointed me. Its packaging is bad.Otherwise it is a very good headphone in this price segment.  I really liked it.

"Great earphone in sound and built quality but not that good in range. Sound quality is great, even earphone is balanced and stays back in your neck. Battery is also good as I've never counted on timer but yes more than 6 hrs. Earphone can run whole day or single charge. Butto s are good and all functional as told.Mic is too sensitive even small pin drop in room feels like loud sound to person on other side of call.I found only range and mic sensitivity issue, even sometimes sound lags when device is in your hand or pocket.I returned it on these 2 factors only, rest are good.

"First of all,, This review is about Boat Rockerz 255 Bluetooth earphone. Generally , I don't have the habit of writing product reviews but this s*** earphones made me review this in order to save the other consumers who are planning to buy this CRAP. In my opinion ,,Firstly , An earphone should be comfortable to wear. In this regard,, it makes you to cry in pain even after 5 minutes of usage !! Secondly , it should have a good audio Quality !! It's just okayish when it comes to sound quality, Nothing great to talk about it. Overall, Never buy this earphone even if they give it for free unless if you wanna hurt your ears with this abysmal earphones.

"Best deal if you are getting it under 1500. They are easy to use and sound quality is exceptionally good, which is least expected at this price. The built is such that they don't easily fit in any carry case especially not in the one which is mentioned in bought together catagory. The battery time is great but the info regarding the percentage battery left can be deceptive as displayed. One moment it displayes 60 % and next moment it's exhausted. But the backup is great . Can be listned for more than 4 hours when connected

"Got it at 900/- at a sale and it's a bang for the price. The Bluetooth connectivity is quite good and connects properly everytime. The range is around 10 metres and the sound distorts if you are in another room. The sound quality is okayish.. Neither too loud, nor too low. The disappointment is that the bass is flat. Don't know whether this defect is only on my device or for the entire range.  Battery backup is around 4-5 hours. But will drain your phone's battery really fast. It's a really good deal for the price, but it is not that great!Hit Like of this helped you.. Happy buying! ☺️

"Sound quality is great and good bass, but disappointed with product design. Volume up/down tone is played whenever there is a change in audio stream. Example while scrolling Facebook and Instagram videos page, Volume up/down tone is played each time before start of the video. This is very irritating, looks like product design fault. I have observed this on my iPhone 6+, not sure about Android behavior.Note: this is behavior observed after device volume control is used.

"Bought this for 1999. I was hoping this would be better than the Chkoko earphones I owned. Build quality is flimsy, but I wasn't expecting any better for the price. The Bluetooth connection was smooth, but the range is that for 10 feet.  Expect that to drop significantly if you walk out of the room or if there is a wall in between. Didn't fit into my ear very well and felt uncomfortable.Was surprised by the distorted sound quality. I am not an audiophile but these earphones don't do justice oo higher volumes and on call mic operations. Would not recommend. Returned.

"I was under confusion about the brand ""boat"" as most of us are habituated with Sony -senhiser-jbl etc.I gave a tried and very happy about the sound output you can go for it without hesitation.Super bass and treble as like senhiser.Small part need to check from boat company that is charging point of ear phone can be redesigned.

"Comfortable to wear and extremely simple to set up. Got a funky feel to the brand. I feel the sound has a higher bass tone, which can’t be adjusted. Battery life while on calls should be better. That said, this set is really growing on me and worth the price (1.8k)

"At first it's look good. While using sometimes it fell out of the ears. I have changed all the earbuds to suit my ears but it fell of when you are looking down.Now it's stopped left side. No tanglin nothing don't know how it stopped. Don't waste the money by buying cheap Bluetooth.I had a faith in boat because of their sound quality which they had in small budget earphones but this one is not worthyBass is medium not punchy for that bass  you can choose boat basshead  ₹599 its very good.

"Go for the headphones blindly if you are getting it below 1500. Such a awesome sound quality. Had been using it for almost 6 months and they are awesome I tell you.  Best part it is not like most of the bass earphones who sound is not bearable. Just a con, when connected to two devices, say you are listening to music from computer and suddenly receive a call from phone then the voice is bit shaky. Also the range is too good for a earphone like this. Best one from Boats!!!!

"The product seemed good initially (including the design, weight balance, sound quality etc). However, within 15 days of use, it has started behaving funny as it gets disconnected after 30 minutes of use (even when mobile is in my pocket).

"More than what I expected. I always brought high end earphones and lately understood that high-end earphones are not worth the price.Hence I went for this budget one (1100 rs).Its really awesome .It’s quality is equal to the high end earphones I had.Never expected such a excellent sound output.There is a good balance between Bass and Treble.Lightweight and raging red colour addsup to the euphoria it creates. Unmatchable sound quality for this price and comfortable wear.

"People having Sony or other good earphones experience, don't go for it. You will not like it at all.I am personally a Sony user, but after a long time I wanted to other brand.

"It says it can connect to two devices, but, it does not. You have to disconnect from first to connect to second. And then it takes too much time/tries to connect to the second one.

But I want to talk about today's experience I am traveling for around 8 hrs now its incredibly working awsm, no battery issues, no connectivity issues, still 60% battery remains. I think its bcos of short distance range.Earlier I used to take it everywhere hung up on my neck and it everytimes it took time to reconnect. So all in all happy with it now.

"Sound quality is great in this price range. Built in plastuic. Looks a little fragile but does the job in Rs. 999. You need to take a little care of them.

"I have used a couple of budget wireless earphones in my life and this is by far the best one. The sound quality is just too good for the price. Noise cancellation is just average. The sound stage is definitely on the base heavy side but not too basey. There isn't much loss in sound quality when increasing the volume. On the whole this is a really good earphone and a amazing deal. I recommend this to anyone trying to but their first pair of wireless earphones.

MI is easier and much lighter to move around with.I use either as per my need.

"Pro's - Packaging, easy wireless syncing with laptop/android, noise cancellation, battery.

These headphones are useful for sports/workout only.  Not for serious music listening or any use which needs use of the mic.

"The earphone is fine. The wire is way too long which is annoying during worouts. The wire at the neck is way too thick. Seems like wearing a hairband around the neck. I do not like it for that reason. It will just keep shifting from one side to another and will distract you during workouts.Dound quality is good. However, the bluetooth range is not so good. It starts to disconnectent while moving in the gym from one side another.
",negative
"sound quality: heavy bass, the vocals and instrumentals are a little drowned out by this. But I prefer heavy bass for workouts.build: build is pretty good and flexible.  it has a frame which goes around the neck, this can be kind of annoying when running or jumping, but i just tuck it underneath my shirt.  the eartips havent fallen out yet, they are a great fit.function: just a reminder that to change tracks u have to hold down volume up and down keys, double tapping middle button actually calls the previous person you called.

"Perfect and strong build but sound quality isn't enough.The metal was too strong.It is Water resistant #testedEven after I've met an accident its still working perfectly.But the earpiece was too big and it may cause pain in the ears.Doesn't fit while sleeping or wearing a helmet.Sound quality was much better..!!A bit noisyBut everything  else is perfect..!!

"Im a kind of headset freak, was already having bunch of wired headsets and few wireless as well. I must say that by 2k u wont get any better product than this.In all perspective be it as bttery capacity, sound clarity, when taking calls I believe it out performs all the other BT earphones atleast in 2k budgeted earphones.Have a collection of BOAT branded earphones & wireless speakers, from that experience i can honestly say that BOAT never disappoints u.

"Pros:Nice Noise cancellation for a bt at the priceMagnetic eartipsCall quality is good with noise calculationNice bass for a bt headset at the pricePretty convenient while commuting because it's a bt headsetCons:If u r thinking about playing Pubg on it, then forget it. It's mic doesn't work with Pubg and voice is very low.Not the best sound quality at 1500 because it's a Bluetooth headsetOk battery lifeWires slightly longer than what's convenient

"I have tried few other wireless earphones but beats coming from this one is great. It gives a good balanced sound and it is so comfortable that it can be used for long duration. Battery life is also good, battery is easily giving 5 6 hrs of backup. I only found one thing that can be better that it takes a while to charge the battery completely, 1.5/2 hrs for charging.I have Boats wireless speaker also and that piece is also nice.Go for it.

"Sound quality is not crystal clear...On high volume it's very bad...The microphone is very bad actually that doesn't have noise cancellation...when ever I take a call when there is little disturbance...They other person is not able to listen my voice but he's able to listen all the disturbances.I literally hate this.even I replaced but the same problem that means this product is not well built
",negative
"Listening to Music:The sound quality of the earphones is good. The bass sounds are slightly over boosted; which may annoy some of the listeners. Bass lovers can buy without hesitation.Connecting Calls:The call quality is disappointing. The inbuilt mic is not that great. The other person's voice that we hear during a call is also slightly distorted when compared with making a call without Bluetooth earphones.Over all build quality is good.

"Ill give you honest review about this earphone. Excellent performance. Battery life very good. You can use whole day. I ordered 3 at a time from myntra at 900rs. That's was a very amazing offer on it. 2 connection works perfectly. But sometimess it gets auto disconnect but again it gets connected. But this is a case of one of my earphone, not with every earphone. I have all three colours. I'llI recommend you to buy this, as at this price you will not find any better earphone. Overall value for money.

"The unit stopped charging within months of purchase. Was replaced by boat in 10 days of complaint with a refurbished unit. The replacement provided was faulty with distortion of sound in one side and a 5 hour charge lasted for only 30 mins. Had to raise another complaint. Seems they don't do proper quality check before giving replacement. Will update on this basis the experience of the second complaint raised.

"Not upto the mark. I thought it is one of the best product.  But sound quality is average. Battery dies in just 4 to 6 hours. Getting pain in my ears as I wear this while watching movies or listening music. I thought there was some problem with the product I got first so I had to replace this item. But the product I got this earphone second time then I realised it's not just one item  but the whole model is bad. In just 1 month it's gone. Not charging and cannot switch on the product.I would rate just 0 star.

"I am using this product from last 4 month and got 1 replacement as well. This device is my second headphone.What is best -Battery life - 8 to 10 hrsDurability - if you will use without folding wire this is great.Sound - Amazing.Pairing - you can keep pair with 2 devices like I continually use with cell phone and my Fire tv stickWhat is bad - No noise cancellation so its bad when you will call someone as they will keep listen noise from your side whether your Tv volume is at 2 or 3

"Just unboxed the Boat rockers 255I am in love with the audio output.. Its simply amazingJust a bit sceptical about the genuinityNot sure if i have received a new unit .. the area where the wires connect to the earpiece seem like it was stuck for the 2nd time.Please notice in the image how well the area where wire meets earpiece near the green arrow looks well but the one near orange arrow is not... There is a white ring around it.

"I am trying to use it for calls. But there is too much noise and other person is not getting my voice. So I think waste of money to purchase this. I can connect this device to two platform computer or mobile. But there will be noise while using it. Within a month it's stopped working now. Useless product, Please don't purchase it. It's stopped charging now. You have to disconnect one device then you can take the call.

"Cool earphone It can cover 3 to 5 meeter range and earbuds are good take the shape of inner ear but earplugs which are fitted in ear have loosed and sometimes come out from buds so I have to very carefull about it.

"Over all it is a below average product.-Very uncomfortable in my ear, painful after 15-20mins only.-Sound quality is very low and not clear many a time.- Bass is ZERO.-As you can see in the picture, it is on charging so frequently.- and the WORST part is; you are not allowed to return it even you want to replace it Amazon will replace it with the same product, why the hell I'll order the same product again with so many flaws.Amazon atleast allow me to pick other product.

"Writing review after using 2 months of the product. Initially the sound quality was good and the connectivity was also good. But after one month of use connectivity problem started. After two month of use one day it suddenly got turned off and I was not able to turn ON the device.

"I have used it for 1 day and no complaints till now. Build quality is good. Very light weight. Sound quality is good. It has super extra bass so those who don't like extra bass have to think on it before buying. Battery life is also good 5hour 35 minutes. Saw 2 movies in a day along with attending calls. Charging time is approx 2 hours. One of the good features I like that when you connect to android phone it shows headphone's battery icon next to bluetooth icon. That battery icon show how much charge is left.

"This is disgusting. The product stopped working in exactly 12 days. Bought on 7 Mar 2019 and the return deadline was a 10-day window. This is utter nonsense. Don't know how to return this damn crap now. I'll need to file a suit rather, for the benefit of greater good.Current update as on 26 April: I got the replacement product directly from Boats company and Amazon played no role or assisted in anyway.

Worst product, worst service Dont buy.

"Sound Quality : The sound quality is very good... Good baas... At higher volume the bass tends to overpower the vocals but at this price point the audio quality is very good.Battery life : takes around two hours to charge completely. I do not use it continuesly but it can give you around 6 hours of music playback and talk time included.Durability : around the neck design allows the earphone to be used freely... making it tangled free... durability of the wire is also very good.

"Got it for 999 during a flash sale.The left earphone stopped working properly within a week. Got it replaced.. Thanks to amazon.The replacement is even worse. The battery dies down within 2 hrs of usage. And to top it off, the boat support is being handled by idiots who say that battery damage isn't covered under warranty. Even when i mentioned this is a new earphone hardly used for a week, the answer is same.So just stay away from boat products however lucrative the deal might be.

I watched lots of best bluetooth devices video reviews and this one is listed in top 3. Hence considered buying it and it has turned out to be a good decision. Happy with it. Will test it more and update. Hope it will give a good battery life. 110 mah should last long

"The product is super but it is not robust. The earphones does not last long. I bought it on Sep 2018 and replaced it since one earpiece was not working within 4 months of purchase. The customer support is excellent but it takes 20 days time for the overall process. Again after 9 months of puchase, one piece is again not working. Sound quality is awesome. One cons is there that while calling, the other person recieves the sound too loudly any it irritates the receiver.
",positive
"It is one of the best Bluetooth based wireless earphones currently available in the market. The battery backup usually lasts up to 8 hours of continuous music listening. Since it is in-ear design, hence noise cancellation is good, however, it lacks active noise cancellation, which I am sure is not present in any product of a similar cost.Overall, it is a must buy and good to have.

"I am totally satisfied with the sound quality, durability, noise cancellation mic and finally battery was awesome but as a bike rider I am not going to suggest this one as it doesn't fitting to our neck when we ride two wheeler.When we r driving the band behind the neck  is going back for air which is totally uncomfortable for user and pilon on the bike.For my Samsung galaxy MAX through this bluetooth headphones i can't use Google assistant as I not supporting for my device, I am not sure this problem is for everyone or not

"Sound quality is not so good and not so bad, I'd say average. Bass is good but not so strong with treble. But the main problem is the durability. In 3 months, battery started draining in an just an hour long usage and also phone calls stopped working. This is the second time I'm having a terrible experience with BOAT earphones, earlier with a different model. I'm really starting to think if they're worth it because of this durability concerns.

"Merits:-1. Been using it for last 2 weeks. The earphone's sound and the bass is mindblowing.2. Once if u fix the earphone into the ear you can't hear anything from outside even without playing songs.3. About the charging, they have mentioned 6hrs standby but it will be upto 7 to 9 hrs also if you are  using it continually.4. Sweat proof is also awesome,  Very flexible,  weightless. Demerit:-1. Ear buds are not perfectly fit but u can enjoy enjoy the music.

"The best part about this headphone is its sound quality, immersive and deep, way better than some of the more famous brands in this price range.However, there are no other major features in the headphone, and it is a bit clunky (not user friendly) to use.But if you just want to pay for the sound quality and not the frills, then this is an exceptionally good headphone

"Quality is not upto the mark. Instead you can just go with JBL wireless. It is just 300 rupees more than boat or you can opt for JBL wired which is just 800 bucks and way more worth than boat. Too much noise in the background. It even got replaced once but no use. Now they have only replace option and no refunds. Waste product. Don't even like it. It's just fallen in my drawer everyday and I don't feel like using it at all.  DO NOT EVER BUY BOAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR QUALITY.

"Sound is very good.....but i think their is a design issue which make it not fit in ear properly.... that's why one can't experience the bass properly if not tightly pushed in. Battery life is suprb upto 6 hours and charging time 1.5 hrs. But due to metal finishing in winter it becomes very cold and hurts the ears. The summer u can think....Its a nice purchase for listening music but some  designing faults i can see that's it.

"Not great sound quality. The bass is over amplified. But its a comfy fit and does an excellent job in cancelling out external noise. Some of the JBL headphones in the same range will provide you with better clarity of sound, wherein the mids are well highlighted along with the bass. But if you like fo listen to music with heavy bass, then these are definitely a better pick. Boat makes quality products for the given price.

"Excellent headphone for calls and music. But if you are gamer, you will face issue of sound. As it is bluetooth device, you will get sound delay by .5 sec. Like when i play pubg using this headphone, I get sound delay. So sometimes its difficult to spot any enemy in close range. No issue with headphone, it is because of bluetooth connectivity. And you gonna face this issue in every bluetooth headset. So go for wired if gaming your priority.

"Amazing bass at that price range. Play with equalizer and you can milk the most out of this earphones. However, one small drawback with this earphones is that when the earbuds is inserted firmly, it tends to kind of air lock the ear which is necessary for Noise cancellation but not so good for your ears.

I also own an Audio Technica M50x, but now it rarely sees use due to these quite marvellous earphones. Note that these headphones costed north of ₹9,000, while these earphones were a fraction of that price. Good job, boAt.

I used  this one with care as mentioned in manual and used for only two hours a day every day and two. Very very disappointed. I guess they compromised the quality to compete with competitors price.

"One of the best in-ear phone that I have ever used it so far.. This one rely rocks..Amazing sound quality and one of the lightest ear phone suits very well for most of the sports activities...

"Just good, always facing problem while connecting to other devices like laptop or other phones of Bluetooth version 4.2Too long wire, not much comfortable.Battery percentage of earphone also showing wrong in phone. It shuts without notification of low battery in phone.Notification language for power on, power off or battery low is also not clear in earphone. DISAPPOINTING

"Pretty good product. Clear sound.Only complain I have is every time you turn it on it announces ""hello, power on. you are now connected to boat rockers"". Consider this announcement when you are halfway through in an important call and are connecting to Bluetooth now. Not that other parties hear the announcement but you don't hear anything from call while the announcement is on.
",positive
"Pros:Easy to useGood quality material usedConsNoise Cancellation is very poor. The person on the other side of the call will hear person speaking next to you in a public place, rather than you. I'm extremely upset with this and hence would like to return it.Ps: Doesnt make sense to save few bucks and buy a sub standard product, instead opt for some other brand

"I'm really love it... Bass lovers pls go for it.. Now I'm really a fan of boat headphones... Lite weight.. Battery life is good it's giving continues play back of 6-7 hrs.. Perfect fit... If u guys looking for a Bluetooth headphones under 1500 just go for it... Really worth it..
",positive
"Sound is good, Noise cancellation is good, some very rare time the other side of person is unable to hear my voice which may b due to my mobile network not sure. One thing designwise i wanna mention here which i little feel uncomfortable is the size of the earpiece which bulges out so much tat when wearing Helmet it gves a lot of pressure inside the ears from the helmet and it becomes air tight 😐 If Boat can make it little sleak or small in size!!
",positive
"Nice product at a price of 999. Sound quality and noise cancellation is good. Only problem I have noticed is that whenever it goes out of my Mobile's range, even for 2 seconds, it doesn't get connected automatically and I have to connect it manually again. Rest all looks ok.I am using it for 3 days now and battery life, call quality etc is satisfactory.Can't comment on durability at this stage.

"Best headphone for this price range mids, bass and treble are at good tuning. Bass is a bit Punching which is nice for bass heads. There is no big lag in time but found a little lag in gaming audio. Neckband is extremely light weight can't feel it like wearing and flexible too.

"Completely perfect product. Sound quality is really awesome. I'm real sound quality seeking guy. The product meet my requirements. Super bass and clear sound as well. It really plays all kind of frequencies. Noises cancelled by 97%. It's genuinely toched me. Thank you BoAt. Thank you Amazon.

"Please read it before you buying1. Sound quality is good but not loud enough2. Battery is good3. Bluetooth connectivity is good4. Wire is too longBut the main part, it is a headphone and you should put it on your ear, but believe me after using 10 min you feel pain in ear, frequently it fall from ear, it is not light weight so it irritating your ear and head. So please buy a light weight headphone to do the main job.

"I got it yesterday,used it for mrng walk,quality is good,very comfortable to wear,call quality is good but not great,Base and vocals are clean and neat,noise cancellation is good enough,but what i found was there is lot of disturbance and noise while playing music online,sometimes i felt like it is getting disconnected for a fractiin of second, then playing again,thats d only thing i found in cons, but overall a very good buy in the price range.

"I bought this product three months ago, and until now I'm satisfied with the performance. It's battery life is amazing, one single full charge can last upto days if your use is average hours per day.Sound quality is good bass is little on the low side. It has water and sweat resistance, makes it very easy for me during exercise, without the fear of damage to my product.It comes at an optimal range, buying it is win-win.

"I have purchased this product 2 months ago now after using i can say this nice product in this range...sound quality is good, just need to improve battery life bit more,once you charge you will get 2-3 hrs maximum backup.You can add only one device at a time although there are other Bluetooth headphones comes with dual connection.There is no magnet or any kind of knot so you have to be very careful every time when you are not using

"These earphones are awesome and there is no trouble with them. Those who are saying that they don't have bass are wrong i have used them and the bass is seriously pretty strong for wireless earphones in such a price range. They are not over priced as well. Moreover while talking over them the person on the other side also didn't face any difficulty hearing me. These earphones are great, I personally highly recommend these.

"I'm giving 4 stars as overall because the product is all good but the packaging wasn't satisfactory. The box was bit damaged fortunately the product wasn't damaged. Sond quality is above average but the better thing in such price is IPx5 sweat resistant.

"First thing first, there is no bass at all only shrill treble. Bluetooth connectivity breaks down beyond 3 meters while it's falsely claimed that it has a range of10 meters. Absolutely no proof of them supporting bluetooth version 5 as claimed on the website . Chinese product with a lot of exaggerated claims.Last but not the least, the headphones have a very poor in ear grip and keep falling out despite the extended over the ear additional support. Changing the earbuds also doesn't help solve the problem.Returned them for them being very ordinary headpu that couldn't provide any real listening pleasure.

"The earphones are water resistant. The control stick is not. They stop working as soon as the tiniest bit of sweat reaches them.

Best suggestion to someone whos looking for bluetooh earhone in this price range... im listing the pros and cons below. if you want.pros:1. sound quality and noise cancellation is above expectation2. Bluetooh Conectivity is fast.3. Charges quickly. it hardly takes me 30 mins charge.4. Charge last more than 4 hrs for continous users. for moderate users it would last 7-8 hrs depending upon ussage.5. Good quality of earbuds that fits perfect in ear and wont hurt for continuos use.cons1. connectivity is wont last longer tha 2.5 mtrs.2. fits slight loose over ear, if you have small ears like i have.Note:havent checked the water resistivity yet. But as of my routine this earphone is resistive to slight swet

"Keeping the cost in mind and the Amazon's tag as a promise i bought this product and uts been a week since now and here is my review about the product.The initial impressions of the product is good and the build quality feels solid.It packs all the usual stuff which includes ear tips and other things.The design of the product seems good with a nice fit which helps in doing some exercises while in use.Water resistant and sweat resistance functionality adds to the usage of the product under various conditions.Coming to the performance, it definitely does good with some decent bass and the clarty is good.Coming to the cons i dont feel there are many but the bass might be an issue for some people who use too high bass but thankfully thats not an issue for me.Overall a worthy product

"The earphones are of good quality, was looking for earphones in budget, have tried boult space but these are much better, the bass as per the name is perfect, the vocals are also clear and overall the sound is pretty good compared to 'boult space' in which you hear only bass and no vocals. The only thing which i didn't liked was the distortion at full volume but that much volume is not safe for human ear, For better experience keep the volume at 75%.The ratings are below :-Bass - 4.5/5Vocals - 4.5/5Fit - 5/5Bluetooth range - 4.5/5Battery - 4/5

"Most of the I use wired earphones , but given there are situations in which a wire does get in the way 'such as when working outside' and it results in me accidently ripping , them out of my ears.Hence I decided I should try out these wireless and see what all the praise was about, So I did my research and decided on these, so Here is a pro's and con's list for any shoppers considering this item:Pro's:-It Comes with plenty of extra ear pieces.-Battery lasts a long time.-It includes good packaging too.-Wire around back of neck prevents earbuds from falling to ground.-The magnet holds earbuds together when not in use.-Sound quality is actually quite good.-The contols are good and the buttons feel tactile too.-Useful buttons for performing certain tasks.-Noise canceling.-Sweat Proof.-Quite inexpensive.Cons's:-You have to charge it ""this is obvious but it still a negative when compared to wired versions""After these I have tried many other wireless earphones and they have changed my mind on going wireless, Very good product overall

"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product ... and I am a ""foolish Indian.""Here are a few facts about this product: It is made in China, like every other Indian product is. And on the streets of Shenzhen, you will find this product for less than INR 100. 150 tops. At that price, this would have been a 5 star product. But, at about INR 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has NOT gone through quality control.Let's see what all is wrong with the product: The biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. What do I mean? See the attached photo. Those are two ear plugs that go over the RIGHT side of the headset! Two!! Putting it more clearly, there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! Why is that a problem? Because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. Putting it more clearly, without those rubber ear-plugs, the headset keeps slipping off my ear, and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!Issue #2: the controller, where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that, without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.Issue #3: Are you driving? Are you jogging? Are you in a typical Indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? Nope! You can't use this headset, because it will keep slipping out of your ears.So, why didn't I return it? Because:1. I am a typical Indian who likes to be made a fool of by Indian companies,2. I am lazy,3. I just didn't want to wait for Amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.Overall, I lost INR 700 by being a typical Indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes, wishes and prays that some Indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.Bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. I wasted my money, but you shouldn't!

"This is my first purchase from this company...so I was a bit hesitant...but I must say...these are the best in its class... bought it for my husband...sound quality is very good and magnet in ear plugs makes it very easy to stay around neck...only setback is...I m unable to fit those extra rubber covers on it...because they both seem to be for left ear only. Well...that's not a big issue...will soon find a way out ..I hope so... overall....these are worth...go for it.

"Purchased these headphones from Amazon and were timely delivered. I've been using these headphones for a week now, here's a review -PROS :1. Sound quality is crisp - high, mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. Given these are not in-the-ear headphones, I still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. But I really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. Battery is ok I guess, these are my first Bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. Once fully charged I can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.CONS:Only the earbuds/tips need some improvement, they slip out easily. Other than that can't think of other points.*Regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

Takes negligible time to connect with server. Sound quality is very good and those magnet provided at the back of ear plugs makes it very handy to carry. Battery life is also good plus the noise cancellation is also effective. Overall it is a good product, worth the price and one should go for it.

"The product is surprisingly good. I thought at this price the functioning Will be basic. But they have included volume keys too. Audio quality and noise cancellation is also satisfactory. But the battery backup is very low. I'm only getting around 2.5 hrs backup while using calls. Also it starts saying ""Low battery!! Please charge!!"" once the charge is below 20% repeatedly making it literally unusable

"These are excellent bluetooth earphones as expected! The sound is clear with  music , videos and phone calls. The caller can be heard very clearly as well as the caller can hear me with no disturbances. Also along with these ear - plugs are so that the chances of sliping reduces. It is best for  travelling as it is bluetooth earphones. Along with this you will be getting charging wire and main benefit is that you will be getting 1 year warranty with it😍😍😍

"i bought this earphone for my friend, i thought the price was reasonable so bought this, after  receiving my order i must say the sound quality is superb , price is good and easily carry anywhere...color of earphone is attractive red with black mix, this is wireless Wireless no longer means poor sound, either.Bluetooth audio sounds much better than it ever has. It comes with some latest and good technology. After using it you don't have to worry about the damaged or tangled wires, Noise or winds because it will do all the required adjustment to Hear and be heard perfectly. I am happy with this product ,will recommend to my other friends also. Amazing product as a photographer its helps me alot becouse this is wireless earphone. ❤️ I love too spend some money on  latest products from ptron 🎧 😊❤️

The Bluetooth connectivity is at a very high speed, connects very quickly and easily. The buttons r perfect. Shows green n red right while on n off. The speakers have a magnetic joint. The sound quality is pretty good n clear. Can be controlled with the volume buttons. The noise cancellation is a great feature, soundproofs extra voices around. The moisture wicking ear plugs r an extra advantage. Helps in keeping the sweat away. Battery works for quite a good 4 hrs. Comes with charging USB.

But product quality has disappointed me big time - material for the controller doesn't look like made of any alloys... very plasticky and cheap feel, sound quality is also very poor, lacks base which many of us prefer in our earphones. I know, its Chinese make product with 700 bucks of price tag, but has way to go for perfection. Overall 2 star rating purely for Amazon delivery promise. Think before you buy it guys.

"1) the length of the wire is a  couple of inches short2) extremely heavy on one side and keeps falling off from the ear beause of the weight.3) the buds provided with the headset are loose. The bud stays in the ear while the ear phone pops out.4) within a day of using the headset the buds fell off and got lost.  There after unable to use this product. The ear phone don't fit properly in the ear without the buds.5) the Bluetooth keeps getting disconnected.6) no warning before shutting off, because of low charge. If you are in a call, there is hardly any warning of low battery.

So no worries.Fourth- Also it is very easy to receive calls on this by clicking the centre button and changing tracks while listing to music by long pressing + buttonLast but not the least very good battery back up.

Most importantly, its Samsung and one can take the benefit of readily available service centres, if required.

"just go for it. Highly recommend product. Better than any bluetooth earphones I have tried even at double the price. Better than original level U, Tagg inferno . Samsung says battery is 10 hours, I get 12 hours. Range is commemdable. Around 40mtrs easily. Looks good. Sounds good. Dual drivers, expected nothing less. only con is, the. wires are a bit on thinner side. But Samsung warranty policy is nice. They just replace your product with a new one.

"I purchased this product in Oct 2018. But started using this only after November 2018.It lasted hardly 2 months. By 5th January 2019, the following happened:+ The right earbud stopped working.+ The volume automatically started going down, even though the volume was set to max in the device (my phone) and this bluetooth device+ Often started to disconnect frequently - It was like it was having a mind of its own+ I successfully connected with two devices. But almost always one of them gets automatically disconnected after 3-4 hours. We need to re-connect this manually+ Noise cancellation is not there. So, if I talk in a crowded place, the other party will not be able to hear me clearly as there would be disturbance along with my voice tooMy suggestion: For the amount of money spent, this is definitely not worth. Please try out something else other than this. This product is only for people who have money to burn without expecting any returns.

"Sound quality is awesome, I am a frequent traveller of train & bike, I love active noise cancelation, no interruption of BT connection & battery life great. Comfy piece, yes It takes 2 3 days to get comfy with ear piece as it is heavy & big but one can get familiar with it very soon. Only draw point is earpiece cable robustness. Very thin & breakable cable used for both ear piece. It may get broken on very slight pull. Please be careful. Else excellent.

"I don't understand what there reviews r for either the song u all listen to are of bad bit rate or u just dunno what to expect. I'm coming from using bose jbl n all n trust me as far as Bluetooth codec goes for non Samsung phone it uses sbc which is still good u just won't get the extra teeny beeny stuff like dolby n all if u have in ur lappy or phone but for Samsung phones u can enjoy their own codec which r good sbc people say its bad coz low cost devices use it but u can check the net n research urself its really capable codec just give it the hardware to run it and for other devices that that says they use aptx well they do but their speaker can't even deliver what's the point in having aptx . But still the sound quality is excellent nothing to complain for 3k the kids high n lows r all balanced n superb everything is clear for all who want bass like the Sony xb series not for u these arnt made to enhance bass but its there definitely n plays only when it needs to n i like that not making every little thing bassy is not good for the song too. Battery life is good too I use with high volume ( coz u like it loud) at 100 n boy I got 8 hrs out of it which is normal coz companies usually advertise at 70 % volume. The mic is good too the person on the other end literally though I'm still using my bose soundlink 2 mic. Not sure what's with the other reviews but imma say just go for it it's worth every penny. Noise cancellation is passive noise cancellation u get 3 different size ear tips use the correct size n passive noise cancellation should work

"Ossam looks, sturdy design, light weight. Not recommended For music lovers as sound is too metallic N poor bass (unless You forcefully push it in ur canal N align it at a certain angle which may b painful after prolonged use)  But a must have For calling. Connects 2 devices at a timeHowever after a few weeks use, I found That battery indicator is total waste. It may Show 100% once then suddenly drop yo 55% N then Keep steady at 55% N suddenly 0. So that's one thing samsung can improve in nxt update

"I have purchased u flex from Croma and purchased another from reliance digital showroom. Whether it a a voice call or music, this is top rated bluetooth headphone. Samsung branding and premium quality looks is an add on. It works best with S8 and note8 above models (Dolby atmos) and it has a dedicated app for sound effects.The most important advice I would like to give u all is don't buy from Amazon or any other online websites. Croma / Reliance digital / Samsung showrooms are the only official sellers of this product.

"I have bought this earphone out in a store and have been using this since the last couple of weeks. This is one of the best purchase that I have ever done in the audio segment. It has a good bass and proper sound clarity for both the music and calls. It really serves the purpose and it also has a very good battery life that keeps the device consume less energy even if its connected round the clock. With the use of Samsung Level App, one can customize options like Vibration, app alerts, call alerts, battery level, etc. If you are using Samsung mobile which is higher than S7(Unsure if it works for models prior to S7), it also has the additional functions to customize the equalizer level as well. In my opinion, this has been the bluetooth audio device type that I have been looking to buy and I am satisfied with all the functions & audio it offers. I would definitely recommend this for any music lovers.

"Audio started getting distorted in left earpiece by third week of purchase.

"I was looking for a budget friendly wireless earphones similar to apple earpods as those ""in-ear"" types don't fit my ears properly.I then came across the JBL Tune 205BT randomly and I did not find any reviews online.I took the plunge and bought it. Below is my review after using it for a couple of days:**Fit/ErgonomicsI really love these earpods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.These are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.Since I got these I just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.Rating: 9/10**Built QualityBeing a JBL product I had no doubts that the build quality would be top notch.The cables are solid but the buttons are a bit squishy. I personally prefer clicky tactile buttons.Since these are not connected to anything physically there is no tension on the wires which are around your ears which I imagine would prolong the life of these earphones.Please note that the center button is to turn off/on and put the earphones on pairing mode.The other two buttons are to adjust the volume and you have to hold it for a second or two to skip tracks.Rating: 7/10**SoundTo explain this better I’ll compare this with my previous earphones - Boat Bassheads which is fairly common.Now, the Boat earphones are the ""in-ear"" type and these usually provide better bass since they have a better seal and tunnel the sound directly in your ear but when I used them the bass seemed to be seriously lacking.I had enabled my phone's equalizer and used other software mods (Viper) to improve the sound but still the bass sounded ""hollow"" like a deep snare drum.The JBL Tune 205BT is a thousand times better in the bass department as I found it to be really deep and it has that thump (because of the 12.5mm drivers).I'm really impressed that these earpods sound better than in-ear earphones and are better than Apple’s earpods too. I also used previously a couple of Philips’ earpods style earphones but they too had the hollow bass effect.I'm currently using the JBL Tune 205BT earphones without any equalizer as I find it to be tuned perfectly out of box. I generally listen to Hip-Hop and these JBL earphones really do it justice especially the 808 kicks.I was a bit sceptic at first about the sound reading the reviews of the wired version of these earphones online but I guess the people who are complaining about the bass not being good are really conditioned to crank up the bass to the maximum which then overpowers the overall sound spectrum.Rating: 9/10**Volume & Noise CancellationSince these are Bluetooth earphones the overall volume will be less than the wired ones.That being said, I found the volume to be enough and then some more.Don't expect noise cancellation on these because of the earpods style tips but that's great for people who jog/run as you have to pay attention to cars, people shouting etc. but turning up the volume you generally don't hear outside sounds. I tend to keep mine around 70-75% volume.The sound doesn't distort at maximum volume.Rating: 7/10**Connectivity, Range & CallsThe JBL Tune 205BT earphones support Bluetooth 4.0 meaning no aptX or aptxHD codec support but that's okay because the improvements are only apparent when listening to high bitrate music (FLAC).(I have subscription to Google Play Music which plays music in 256kbps and I have no issues with the quality).Once these earphones have been paired to your phone, the next time you turn it on it connects in 1-2 seconds.I did not experience any disconnects or any lags. The range was pretty good, I leave the phone on the charger and move around the house without any interruptions.When we talk about calls, I didn't find these earphones that good because the microphone rests on your shoulder and I'm not one of those who shouts when talking on the phone but if you have a loud voice then this might work for you.Rating: 8/10**Battery Life & Charging timeThe charging takes around 1 to 1.5 hours to charge from 0% all the way till 100% and based on my usage (which is a lot) these earphones easily last me a day.Your mileage might vary.Added bonus: You get the battery info on the status bar. I'm using OP3T on Oreo.Rating: 8/10**PriceI thought thousands of times before buying these as I never spent so much for earphones before.But in retrospect I'm glad I did buy these especially considering what you're getting in return.Rating: 10/10***ConclusionIf you're on a budget and want earpods style Bluetooth earphones then please buy this.You won't find anything similar or even close to the sound that you’re getting. I have many JBL products (2 Bluetooth speakers, 1 home theatre system) so I can vouch for the sound.If you're a Hip-Hop or an EDM head then you can buy this too as these have big drivers which won’t disappoint you if you crank up the bass using software equalizers.If this is your first pair of Bluetooth earphones then be ready to be pleasantly surprised as these make your lives so much easier and I cannot imagine going back to wired earphones.

"I'm not happy with this product. If you've use JBL earphones before, you won't get feel like JBL from this product. I've purchased this product in ""Rs 2399""💰 but made quality is not like the price. And important topic is, after every few minutes it'll automatically disconnect from device you connected if you get any call. Sometimes it unable to response when we've to power off the earphones. If you're reading this don't buy this product, go for another one otherwise order from JBL OFFICIAL SITE, you'll get low price also.

"I used it with OnePlus 6. The sound quality is very poor. There is no way you can increase the sound output.The built is okay.

"My first JBL earbud. Straight to point :1 Sound quality - It's pretty good, clarity and tones. No thumping bass, but you should consider that these are not high end headphones but earphones.  But you will get good bass, notes are clear. I had used apple earphones before and I consider them the best in earphone category and JBL is in par with it. And here it is wireless.2. Battery life - Is good and holding 5 hrs3. Connectivity - Very smooth and no hiccups of any sort. I am using it with iphone. P.s - Near iphone battery life, it shows earphone battery life as well. I like it !!!4. Noise cancellation - I don't know why people are rating noise cancellation for these earphones. It doesn't apply here. If you want noise cancellation earphones/headphones then you have to pay much extra bucks and buy which specifically mentions 'Noise Cancellation headphones'That's it.

"The product i recieved is not even original. This is really disappointing i saw the same earphones at croma which were genuine and sound quality was way better than these. Material used for this product is awful.
",negative
"First of all let me tell you the cons of this productCONS:--> Ergonomically poor design, the buds do not fit in ear they tend to slip off since it's metallic.--> Since it's not a in ear type and metallic, you can't keep the buds more than 30min, you start getting pain.--> Length of the cable is not as shown in the display images, it's lengthy and gets tangled.--> Button quality is not up to the mark. Ok ok--> Battery life is poor. It does not even last for 4 hours.--> Never expected JBL would do such poor engineering and did very bad ergonomic design for this product.--> Since the bud size is small I thought I could use it while riding bike with my helmet on. But as I told it's so slippery, there is no way you can use it with your helmet on. I was very disappointed with all these points.PROS:--> Sound quality is good. No complaints on that.I would definitely not suggest this product to anyone. It's up to you all.

"The earphones don't fit my ears!Within 2 hours of delivery, I called back amazon for a return. But they said return would only be done for a damaged product, so I've to ""live with it"" even if it doesn't fit my ears and I've to hold it with both my hands to keep it in place!Moreover it's extremely UNCOMFORTABLE as there is no rubber.Sound quality seems decent but unfortunately they are so loose in My ears that I'm unable to judge it well. Most of the sound goes out of my ears!The description said its metal earphones, but somehow it feels plastic, so I Don't want to fondle with it too much.Customer care said I could buy some ear clips so that they stay on my ears but I'm not able to find a correct match for it.

"1. You have to be on 100% volume in the mobile to hear some good sound in earphones.2. Battery comes around 3-4hours.3. Comfortable in the ear but wire size is uneven and a big minus. It is bit large than it supposed to be.4. Sound quality is ok , not great and not very poor. I give 35 marks for sound quality.5. Device quality is bit poor, attached a pic . In that you can observe how it is after 1 month.6. Bluetooth range is also ok kind not more than 10feet. If you are in different room it is not connecting.Finally compare to level U, this stays bit low in terms of sound quality and Bluetooth range, but quality wise this is somewhat better than level U. Because my level U got broken in the middle and Bluetooth is connecting now. This earphones are idea for listening some stuff in YouTube but not recommended for music lovers.

"I am writing this review after using these headphones for 3months.Though JBL is a brand name but this headset has connectivity issue.

"Well sorry to say that  the sound quality is good. But its not worth buying it lacks the basic functionality of a good headphone.I want to return itThe battery life is so pathetic that it never lasts more than 3 hours. I previously owned sansung level U and i miss the 2 day battery life. Ease of use and the way it connected.This one disconnects automatically and then has to be turned off and on many times.I hate it i hate it do not buy. Instead go for Samsung level U.

"Didn't like the product earbuds, they are not at all comfortable. Asked my few other friends to try it on, even they said not comfortable. Starts paining in the ear after 20 mins of usage, which results into massive headache.Also there's no return policy from Amazon nor JBL as well.Feels like both companies doesn't care about customer complaint.My suggestion would be to buy another model except this.

"I would have given 5 stars however, please find below my reviews.At first i was very skeptical to buy this earphone after reading mixed reviews. Since i needed a budget earphone i went and booked this. My first impression in regular usage was awesome. Sound quality and bass impressed me a lot. Definitely for regular music lovers this is the best buy and more than worth the money. I am taking away 1 star because i do lot of cardio (running) and because of music control the earphone tries to get pulled because of the weight and its really annoying. Music control is definitely big and heavy. I have tried cardio on threadmill and never tried on road. As of now batter backup is good. I will revisit this review after couple of days usage.

"Tired of reading? Watch full indepth review videoAnd please please subscribe my channel on youtubeJust search for 'jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone review ajit Suryawanshi'So lets start review.....Used the product for 1 month and then writing the review1. Whats in the box? - in box you get micro usb to usb cable used for charging, product itself, and manuals2. Build Quality:- The build quality of earphone is really good. The cable is not braided but actually made up of high quality rubber. Product feels sturdy and premium. Hence in terms of build quality the product gets full marks.3. Comfort:- Talking about the comfort it's personal choice for me comfort is really good but some people found to be uncomfortable and doesn't fit well so i would suggest use apple earpods as a test. Earphone doesn't fell off while running or driving. One side of earphone has soft rubber hence grip in ear is good. Hence in terms of comfort i would give full marks4. Features and Functionalities:- In this area the earphone lets you down. The earphone doesn't support google assistant or siri. The earphone has three buttons. Long press middle button will turn on/off the earphones, while single press is used to play/pause music or take/end calls. Remaining two buttons are used to change volume and music track. Single press will change volume and long press will change track. The volume buttons are hard to press initially but gets soft over a time. Earphone has led indicator indicating on/off (white) connectivity (blue). It is blinking in pairing mode and stays still when connection is established. Earphone uses bluetooth V4.0 hence in terms of range it won't be an issue. You can easliy travel from one to another room.Microphone quality:- its good and gets job done.calling with these earphone will have No issues hereBattery life:- The battery life of these earphone is average i would say. It would get around 4 to 5 hours of battery life which is average in my opinion. It will suffice for 1 working day with medium usage. But on heavy usage you have to top it up. Watching videos or movies will drain battery faster.Charging time hovers around 1:30 hours to 2 hours from 0 to 100%. Earphone doesn't have any fast charging technology.Sound Quality:- Here i would say its a Bomb. It's surprisingly really really good. High are very clear mids are very well defined and base is also really good. You will love to hear all types of music. Instruments and vocals are also very clear and well defined. But yes its not for basshead as earphone are not very bassey. Base is very well balanced and doesn't affect mid and high tone. Hence in terms of sound it will surely put smile on your face.Pros:-1. Good build quality and great design2. Comfort is subjective but it's good3. Sound signature is phenomenal4. Good bluetooth rangeCon's :-1. Doesn't support Google assistant or siri2. Battery life is averageSo lastly do i recommend to purchase these earphones? Well definitely yes, an earphone is know for sound and in this it shines.So overall i would give 4/5 stars as it sounds really goodSupport by pressing help button if like the reviewAnd please subscribe to my youtube channel and please provide valuable feed in comment section. Any questions ask in comment section of youtube will be happy to answer in only minutes.

"Ordered these because of the Apple earpod like eartips, which I prefer to the normal in-ear earphones with rubber tips. They fit really well in my ears. Very comfortable to carry them around the neck. Sound quality is very good...not too high bass, but not too low as well. They are very soothing to the ears.

"Thanks Amazon for providing such an excellent product at a best rate.I really love these ear pods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.These are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.Since I got these I just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.Highly recommend for those who want iPhone ear pods shape and wireless too.Thanks to JBL for making such an amazing product at the best cost.Value for Money.But it doesn’t fit in my ear properly .

"I was looking forward to buy something which fits like apple airpods. Eversince I came back to android eco system I missed my airpods.  I don't like those in ear type earphones.  I tried mi earphones,  oneplus bullets wireless & Samsung galaxy buds ( horrible call quality!) Nothing I liked.  But these are awesome.  Great to wear,  no strain as they are very light weight.  Sound quality is good, call quality is decent.  If you are like me looking for something other than in ear plug types, you are in luck

"These bluetooth headphones are awesome, JBL keeps the sound experience great as always. Pure bass, clear, and crisp trible. The music  coming out is clearly audible even in at low volumes and high traffic (road) conditions. The only concern for me is the battery does not last that long even after a full charge. I highly recommend this to every music lover out there.

"A great product from JBL, as a Bluetooth earphone it's really good, no connection issue, good noise cancellation, good bass and vocals. It's light weight, will not fill any weight in the ear, good connection range. Support both android, iOS in terms of control (buttons). Connect well with laptop but sometimes it's gives fraction of second beep sound but no issues with mobile devices.

"One of the most uncomfortable headphones I tried.Actually, I bought this from Amazon with feeling that I can return if I didn't like the product (and I confirmed the same from one customer care executive). But, when I tried to raise return request it was denied. I told them it's uncomfortable to wear (maybe issue with my ear size), and there are no earpads using which I can wear it, but the so-called technical guy was not listening. He was just insisting that I should try the same and give us call on the last day for return (unfortunately I went out on tour during the same, so they are struck with me). Regarding product, if it fits your ear fine I think you will love this product. If you have sensitive ears, a big no for you.

"I am writing this review after 1 month of rigorous usage.At first I was confused whether to buy this or not. But it is worth every penny guys. Don't think twice just go for it.The earbuds are the main soul of these earphones. There are people like me out there who don't like the insulated one earbuds. This is the perfect earphones for them.Sound Quality: 9/10Mic: 8/10Battery: 7/10 (Could have been better)Noise cancelation: 5/10 (Reason being the non-earbuds earphones)Build Quality: 7/10Overall rating: 8Worth every penny

"I received it yesterday. But I was amazed to see the poor quality of packing done to these earphones.1. Wrapped inside a cheap polycover with some Chinese symbols printed over it.2. It was tape sealed instead of air lock.3. The seal of box was not holographic. Just a piece of tape cut from tape machine.4. Quality of material used for making body of earphones is quiet cheap.I'm don't have second thoughts to, that these earphones are not genuine JBL. They are duplicate.Kindly don't buy. You can't even get refund. They are non refundable.

"Pros:1. Good effective bass2. Light weight and good ear fit while walking although not in-ear. For gym and running one has to check the fit3.Noise cancellation just right enough.Cons:1.Blue tooth connectivity is barely 6 m. Does not work if one walks to the next room.

"Review after 2 weeks of usage.Built quality is Good but not great.Earbuds design gives nice firm Fit in ear and is comfortable for prolonged use.  Not ideal for Sports, Running or Workout.Sound quality is great with good bass. Could have been better though. With WhatsApp, Skype (60Mbps internet) calling voice volume level is good but with same level on Phone call other party complained it being low.Battery holds charge for good enough time 5hrs. Charging time was around 1.5 to 2hrs.Signal coverage is not that great . Sound turns Robotic when you move to different room or so.  Good for distance 10-12ftOverall serves the purpose.

"After using 20 days am writing the review .If you are comfortable with these type of headset you can enjoy . Usually i prefere these kind of headset since it's very comfortable for me . You can enjoy the good quality of music with bass and call quality is very good . You can't feel any pain in ear if you using for long time also and it's really fits perfectly and you will thought some times you are not wearing it .Overall worth to buy , i bought it on offer .

"One of those good bluetooth earphones in the market. Bluetooth connectivity is very good and the sound output is excellent.Perfect bass, no noise while listening to music with high volume. No sound distortion and mic is decent.  But sometimes the mic is being hidden behind the collar of your shirt, so be careful. The battery backup is also good. You can feel the thumping bass when required and might be the sound output is awesome due to its 12.5 mm driver size. I used JBL T210, but this provides better sound.Till now I didn't find any flaws in this earphone. I can say one thing - value for money, you wont regret buying this.

Talking about this jbl headphones , when i opened the Amazon package, the seal of the box was open n the warranty n information booklet packet was also Torn. Now about the product , the product quantity is so poor that it's hard to believe that this is a original jbl product.And now when I'm requesting for returning of the product, the seller is not accepting it . They are just replacing it. And also for replacement they are asking for 1 month time.

"Hi,I Bought this item with lot of expectation and first impressions was good. I do not prefer ear bud headphones hence I bought this one. Within 5 months rubber covering of right earbud removed autimatically ( glue issue ) when I check the same for left, its also having adhesion issue. I contacted JBL and they closed this issue as its physical damage. This damage is due to the non - durability of 2500/- product only. This is not earbud type hence I cannot have a replacement other than throw my headset. Thankyou JBL for selling a non durable product.

"You will not feel them in your ears, if you don't want to stuff your ear canal with plug type earphones this is the best option on Amazon.I am not sure about the technical term used for earphones that have soft rubber plug to block you r ear canal but the internet is flooded with them. You will hardly find an inner earphones that is otherwise.I do no feel comfortable wearing those but didn't want to compromise with sound quality.

"This a genuine buyer verified review. JBL ain’t paid me anything to write this guys trust me:)So about the review will tel u sweet and simple.Rating from 51) Sound Quality: 4.5 Excellent Sound as pure JBL signature and BASS is good considering not a “In-Ear” type setup. If u want good Sound with bass and not a in ear type go for this it wnt disappoint you.2) Useability: 5 out of 5 I bought it because in-ear was causing pain while wearing helmet but these are like Apple earphone finish hence very easy to wear on helmet also.3) Controls: 3 out of five as Track Forward and backward are missing4) Battery’s life: 3 out of 5. Dnt go with 6 hours gimmick it will last Max 5hours mine gives average 4.5 hours in single charge.5) Looks: 4 out of 5 Looks Great while wearing the only issue is the Blue Pairing light is Always ON which may annoy some people. But I think it looks cool. Specially on the white colour one.6) Noise Isolation: 2 out of 5 As these are Apple like shape u can’t expect Noise Isolation it’s good when u are listing alone but in High Public and while driving bike surely u will have to put volume to MAX to isolate noise around u.Overall Happy with the product in this price range if u are looking for earphones without in-ear design and comfort as well Good bass and build quality then u should must go for these without any doubt.

"Can't believe this is a JBL product. Not suitable for running due to the charging port and volume blocks being heavy causing the wire to bounce around while running and eventually pull the earphones off. Terrible!!Sound quality is also very average.Boat, Phillips are definitely better. Spent a lot of money on this and now no return option.
",negative
"Build quality is not satisfactory would've been better, battery is good enough though the sound quality is good need some improvements, for song changing you need deep press +/- button for at least 2-3secs, the worst thing is the mic though you adjust the position of it for several times whether your sitting, standing, walking, traveling and especially driving it is just shit, while your in a call it'll capture all the nonsense from the background clearly rather than your voice which is coming from just 1cm away. I think it has noise installation not cancellation. Overall it is OK, except the mic and noise cancellation.Noise installation: 5 🌟Noise cancellation: -5 🌟Mic : -1 🌟Sound : 4 🌟Bass: 4 🌟Battery🔋: 4🌟Build quality: 2.5🌟Charge time: 4 🌟

"JBL has launched an affordable bluetooth headset without compromising on the sound quality... Though a few days later, the richness of the audio has dropped and the rubber pads in the earpieces has come off... bottomline... sound quality is above average but build quality is bit on the fragile side.

"For being priced at INR 2,199 (that is how much I got it at) it clearly lacks the JBL standard. I haven't yet tested the battery life or noise cancellation but I'm not concerned about them tbh. It's the sound which prompted me to buy these earpods and I'm very disappointed with the sound quality and had they been offered at even half the price I got it at, it still wouldn't have been a good deal.

"These pair of Headphones were supplied by Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.

"First of all i want to convey  JBL to add to some quality in their products if they are charging such a high price for them. I want to share my honest observation and experience about my JBL BT.1. I bought this for the price of Rs. 2199/- which is quite high in comparison to other BT devices containg same features2. Noise cancellation is really poor that if i am outside somewhere the another caller is hardly able to understand the voice properly.3. I bought this device two months back from the very first day it gets disconnected from my mobile whenever any call come then i have to mannually connect it.4. Now its microphone stopped working and the worst part is  i deposited it to the JBL service center on 9th may 2019, they told me that they will take the time of 15days to replace the product even after waiting for more than 20 days i have not recieved any satisfactory answer from JBL customer support then what the hell the term warranty makes any sense.Now they told me that they don't have the same product in the stock and they also don't know when it will be in stock.I am highly disappointed from the customer service from such a highly reputed brand JBL, in my opinion this is just a ordinary BT earphones with a tag of JBL and no quality features.I request  JBL to look into the matter as soon as possible and arrange to replace my product.My service request no. is DL-E250519-25010

"One of the worst in so far I've used. Disconnects automatically. To connect it back I've to off and on sometimes. Totally disappointed.base is just enough. Battery life isn't that great to 3.5-4hrs on max usage. Can't use it for commute purposes. Maybe just gym or jogging. Little heavy on the weight side. So they'll drop pretty easily. Need to take care of that too. Totally dissatisfied. Returned the product. 🙏🏻

"Sound quality is excellent, along with the noise cancellation, battery haven't drained since the time I've bought it (I'm not a regular user) but still it's great. Looks good, only problem I faced was fitting it into my ears as the ear piece is too wide (this is the problem I faced with almost all earphones). But the sound quality overcomes and makes your forget about it. I would definitely recommend it.

"Overall a good product but the only problem is the mic doesnt pic up the voice really well, either when putting it around ur neck u have to talk on high pitch or u have to keep the mic near to ur mouth so that the voice is clear & crisp to the other person on the line.

"I have been using Apple Airpods for 3 years now but after replacing multiple Airpods due to it get broke after using while.  I am a big fan of the sound quality offered by Apple it was very difficult to find a good alternative due to which I replaced over 10 headphones by big brand names. I must admit that JBL tried best to make it perfect choice Apple fans however the sound quality is not that great as my previous headset by Apple

"The product is very good for listening long hours of playback,  you won't even feel that you got your earphones. The sound is good too. The fit is excellent as it has earpods fits. The only major issue is that it's not for call(even the feature is there but the quality is bad) the earphone get disconnect automatically sometimes from Bluetooth and the left earpiece stopped working after 2 months usage(i got it replaced, which btw took 25days). See I myself is a that kind of person who doesn't forget it's earphone at home bcoz I can't survive the same city without it. I keep on listening to music for hours and hours. So if you are like me better raise your budget and buy bullet wireless.

"For a product thats made for mobility, this pair of earphones just is absolutely NOT made for the gym. The built quality is tacky, plasticky. Earphones are large and not in-ear so they slip out often. There's no clip or fastening mechanism to keep them attached or in-ear. Worst of all, 10 days of use in profuse sweat and moisture has killed them. The bluetooth connectivity comes on and off whenever it pleases, rendering them totally useless. Not at all worth the price.

"I bought them from Amazon, ans they were okay, just average sounding earphones, but after a few days, Left earpiece started giving me problem such as low sound or sometimes no sound at all. I tried resetting them but nothing worked, I tried replacing them and the window got expired, I called Harman and they informed I need to send them to Delhi so they can have a look and check them, for like 2K I had to go through so much trouble. Although the delivery was on time as expected but things get worse when customer service is not good or helpful.

"I'm personally not a fan of the ear-plug type earbuds so I went for this. Initially, I was skeptical of the audio quality because these won't be able to seal into the ears as good as the plugs. However, to my surprise, their bass is comparable to some good quality in ears from the likes of Mi & Altec Lansing.Overall, I don't regret my purchase, Got these delivered next morning with amazon prime.Talking about the sound quality, sound is slightly bass heavy and suits my taste. The sound stage is colored and the highs are sometimes faded to compensate for the lows but it doesn't mean that they don't sound good. These sound fantastic!Anyone who wants to listen to EDM or Bollywood go for these. Good product from JBL.

"After receive when i charge and listening song but left side speaker stop working only right side one sound.

"It is pairing nicely but when any media or song or video is being played then sound is interrupting too much. Continues voice is not coming through it. It sounds like corrupt media file..I tried it with 3 different mob but same problem is there.Hope I could return it.

"If you are a base lover blindly go this headphone awesome one, but if you are looking for noise cancelling option dont buy this, search for different headphone.

"When i purchased this earphones I felt rlly good but after someday on right side of earbuds some sort of interaction takes place it’s so distracting the songs waste of 3K money 🤦🏻‍♂️ I think better try fr some other companies other than JBL
",negative
"I don't understand why people are saying sound so low. Sound is just great. I bet you can't listen to music on full volume. Bass is good. Bt range is 15 feet . But price is high on Amazon. I got mine just for 2199 from jbl store.

"I was planning on buying these but fortunately, an office colleague of mine bought one and I got to try it.The fitting in the ear is just OK; it is definitely not painful but pops out as you indulge in some physical activity like running.The Bluetooth connectivity also seems a bit off; the phone was in my pocket and it still gave that mushy noise sometimes.The biggest let down for me was the audio quality. The highs, lows and beats are just overhsadowed by uncontrolled bass. It feels like music being played in an empty hall. Also, the volume is also not very impressive. Definitely not worth the money.I currently use Boat earphones which I bought for Rs.500 and they are way better than these 2k ones.Better go for MiVi or Boat.
",negative
"I was looking for simple ear phones which remain just outside ear and not like other pieces which go inside the ear and we r totally cut off from outside.Such earphones were not available online, even in some good offline stores also.But one day while surfing I found these .I immediately ordered ., bass is deep and loud as claimed , light weight.
",positive
"Bought this from jbl site and was available for 1999 Rs but black color was not available.I did lot of research on Bluetooth headphones before purchasing. Asked some of my friends already using some other company Bluetooth headset. All was having problem while calling. The other person on call hear some disturbance. Mainly I was looking for calling purpose. Following are the pros and cons according to me:Pros-no issue in call on both side. Perfect for callingBattery also seems good to me. Haven’t used for continuous day long but looks like it could hold for day long.Music sound also good. Was using iPhone headset and seems no much difference.In ear comfort also fineLook and quality wise no problemCons: no magnet but given one plastic kind of thing to hold both side wire togetherAuto turn off if not in use. For some it could be drawback and for some battery saving feature.I would suggest to purchase without any doubt.
",positive
"Bought this doubtfully during the great Indian sale. Happy with purchase. I’m against in ear plugs as I feel uncomfortable beyond a point. This ear plug replicates apple earphones and sits on the ear.  Very comfortable and sound is enough to satisfy my needs. Also use it for taking calls so far no issues. Charging time 2hrs and lasts for a day.
",positive
"I think JBL is just a brand name. To be honest this is good for nothing. Noise cancellation is zero, if I am on bike I dont even get which song is playing even on full volume. The bass is okay, not so appreciable as they market it the way it to be. I recently shifted from Sennheiser  brand and quite disappointed with this :-D

I had boat rockers 400.Far better overall sound than that.When listened same song again in this headsets I observed more instruments clearly and where sound coming from unlike boat one.(ex - in Dino dil mera song)2. Battery- depending on song, I listened music with volume varying from 50% to 90%. Well, battery lasted 7hr+. No issue there.I had mi Bluetooth headset in mind.  But warranty was 6 month for that. 1 year jbl. So went with this.So it's like vivo oppo cameras beautify camera photos,same Chinese manufacturer amplify base to sound good.  It's just unnatural.

"Pros:- like me, if you are a sucker for this in-ear design then you don't have many wireless options (and airpods are $$$). It isn't painful and they don't fall off, best is the use while laying sideways.- ~6 hrs on time: almost your days music- 1-1.5 hrs charge- excellent sound, excellent volume- yeah nice touch of baseCons:- the rubber linings do come off due to poor glue which becomes ineffective in heat.

"Bought these headphones in September 2016. the photos i uploaded are from august 2018.i am writing this review after using these headphones for 2 years😅😅.I am a kind of rough user and still this lasted for more than 2 years.and today it broke becuase of my mistake...or else maybe it would have worked for atleast a year.Pros-Best headphone in a price rangeBest music outputBest voice qualityBest for receiving callsUsed them even in moderate rain(dont do it)Cons-Built quality is decent but it could be better as the wire started break after 1.5 years but still this baby worked as a charmSo you can buy it over mi headphones or boat as music isnt that sharp on them but built quality is good.Once again the the photos uploaded abover are after 2 years of rough usage...U should give it a try...

"I usually don't write reviews, but I've bought two of these and haven't been disappointed.The sound quality is good, but for me, the best feature no one seems to talk about is the mic. I take a lot of calls, and though this doesn't have noise cancellation, it works very well for making calls in noisy environments. I rarely get complaints that others are not able to hear me or of traffic noise disrupting calls (a perennial problem in India). I'm able to take conference calls when travelling, which is a huge plus. The build quality is good. There is a problem that the wire connecting the audio input is weak and tends to break if not stored carefully. I've had that problem once, but Sennheiser replaced this without question. I've started storing the pair in the pouch they supply and have not had issues later.The pouch really keeps things secure. A couple of days ago, I forgot to take it out of my shirt before putting it into the washing machine. I later realized this and picked it from the shirt pocket after the washing cycle, dried the pair and found that it worked as usual - a huge relief.I'm not a huge audiophile and don't wax eloquent on basss/treble reproduction and the like, but for me, this is a great pair for my use cases - good music playback, great service and ability to make calls on the street. I find very few reviews focussing on these, so wanted to highlight these for prospective buyers.

"I have used wide ranges of earphones over years, some brands being Skullcandy (Smokin Buds 2), JBL (T 210), Sennheiser (HD 180, HD 210, CX 271, CX400 II Precision, CX 185 Street II, and now CX 275 S) Fiio (f1), Koss (Porta Pro) Audio Technica (ATHCOR150RD),First off there is a large difference between CX 185 Street II and CX 275 S don't even compare, CX 185 has too much of treble with very low bass, CX 275 S is very well balanced, CX 275 S reminds me of my CX 271 which I used for 7 years, its wire was of great quality and tangle free, I would have easily paid an extra 1k for that kind of cable,To anyone looking to buy earphones, go for Audio Technica>JBL if your budget is below 1k and Sennheiser CX 275 S if you just need the best audio output, and regarding other earphones I've used JBL has decent output, and regarding Fiio f1 it is just a piece of crap, it was an impulsive decision I made based just on the brand without any research, don't throw your money in garbage buying it, finally make sure you buy it from a well rated seller.

"Firstly I would like to appreciate Amazon.in for its amazingly fast delivery. The product reached in less than 24hrs and I opted for regular delivery.Now about the Product.I have used or still use products like Audio Technica ATH-M50X , Beats Studio, Powerbeats 2 , Jaybird X2 , Panasonic Extra Bass , Bose SoundTrue, Mi Piston3, etc .These Sennheiser earphones are firstly extremely comfortable and lightweight. They have a very loud sound output. The bass is 4/5, Treble is 4/5. The sound quality is rich and it doesn't feels like a sub 2k earphone. The earbuds are small and therefore allow a comfort fit while listening lying down or sleeping and they do not poke or irritate while listening for long hours.I purchased it for Rs 1600/- , it comes with a leather case and a L - Shaped converter which is very thoughtful .Overall i would highly recommend.

"After successful of senneheiser CX 180 Street II series I thought I have to purchase CX 275s with microphone. When I put on Dolby Atoms mode it is really work as a beast. Nice sound quality powerful bass. It's wirea are thin but looks sturdy and strong I think it would be long lasting headset. And also One & Only Senneheiser name is enough for music lovers. Many people have different kind of ear phone but when I say I have this beast Senneheiser CX 275s other guys said Dada tusi great ho. Really appreciate you Senneheiser!!!:) How could YOU make this type sound quality which have other have name & brand name also but no one can beat you... Thanks a lot for making this kind of ear phone. And also Many Many thanks for Amazon to giving me this type deal and headset. This is gift fromy lovely DAD. Thanks PAPA...for UR love.

"I don't know why this earphone is getting a lot of hate from a lot of people. Quite frankly I've tried tons of earphones at this price point and personally the right amount of bass and excellent lows and mids would describe this earphone. If you want Xtreme bass then I would suggest you to go for Sony or JBL earphones. But this is a balanced earphone with the right amount of bass and good clarity.

"1st.. I will not say the buit quality is the best but it's good, you have to handle with care. Nd the good point is,there is a pouch with nice quality & looks.2.. Main thing I love the most in Sennheiser is its sound quality.  The sound is Crystal clear. You won't miss a single component of music. The bass vocal treble are balanced. Just catch it if you are a music lover.

"Have been using it for over 10 days now and have been testing these beauties under extreme conditions and therefore thought of sharing my experience with this product. I will try to keep it short and to the point.Note : you get 2 years domestic warranty with the product and to check the authenticity of the product, do scan the QR code given on the box.So here we go :👉Look And FeelPremium- thats what you will feel when you hold in your hand for the first time. The material is of excellent quality and offers great durability. The earphones are slightly curved which fits in your ears very comfortably. The three button remote is of high grade rubber and feels smooth while touching.👉ConnectivityThe CX6 from Sanheiser comes with bluetooth 4.2 and connecting your phone is a butter smooth operation. I have tested it with a distance  of about 15 meters and never faced any issue.👉Battery and ChargeThe product claimed of a 6 hours long battery backup but you will get around 5 to 5 and a half hours. But the best part is it supports Quick charge and even a 5 minutes of charge can give you over 1 hour of support.👉Sound OutputThis is where the real test starts when we talk about a headphone and specially when it is at this cost. I have used BT headphones of other companies and can assure you that at this price point, its not the beat sound output but there are no competitors too. The sound is crisp and clear. The treble is just awesome, you can hear every lows and highs of it but the bass is not the best. The bass should have been a little more because thats what I like but again thats depends on person to person. But I can assure you that you will be pleased to hear the music in this headphone and even for long continuous hours.For those giving negative reviews, its adviced that you download the song at the best bitrate and then try this headphone.👉CALL QUALITYHave been using it since 10 days now and during all these days, I have tried to use it as rough as I could in all kind of noisy and louder situations but the product has never disappointed me. The sound cancellation works simply superb and the other party could hear me clearly even when I was in the noisiest condition. Never faced any issue over call quality till date. But many months to go and hoping that the brand will keep its good name as it usually does. Kudos✌️👉VERDICTSANHEISER has been understanding music and sound since 70 years and one thing can be assured that you wont be disappointed with their product. If you are a Sanheiser user, there is nothing to be said about the quality but about this product, you can definitely give it a try and you wont be disappointed and for those who are planning to buy Sanheiser for the first time, reading reviews wont help you, you need to make a BUY and experience it yourself. Since I have been using this product, I can assure you that using BT headphones for longer hours will not be a pain for your ears anymore. I hope that this review has made you make an informed PURCHASE decision because overall you would be spending your hard earned money. Thanks for reading and Happy Shopping !!

"Let me get this straight, the sound from these is amazing. The highs and mids are clear and the low bass end is great. Recommended for bass heads. Fit is comfortable and they don't fall off from the ears.Now the shortcoming, these earphones are not durable. The wire is very thin as compared to other earphones. In the unit I received, sound from the right ear piece had reduced to half after only 3 months of use. But as Sennheiser gives 2 years of warranty, they replaced the earphones without asking any questions. Right now using the replacement ones and they've been working great.

"I purchased this product during last week of October in special offer price.

"Sennheiser are known for their great studio grade sound quality with a flat EQ, and this pair is no different. I really love the sound quality of these headphones, it is full with equal emphasis on the lows, mids and highs without any artificial bass boosting. You get a flat sound which makes this pair really versatile. It is great for movie watching and voice calls. The mic is great. Everyone I called using this pair said I sounded clear with no distortions. Also these come with 2 years warranty which is very nice to have.Now let's get to the cons, and as usual its the built quality. The wires are thin and made up of flimsy looking rubber. I have seen braided cables in headphones much cheaper than this. I would have loved Sennheiser to at least give some quality materials, because you have to really take care or else I feel the wires will break. Also the mic button feels cheap.Overall, this is a great pair of headphones for anyone looking for rich and clear sound. If you like bass, something from Sony would be better for you.

"I have been using cx180 since almost 4 years. Those earphones were of much better quality than the cx275s.The sound quality is OK, but the wires are too thin and feels very delicate. Apart from the quality, I had hard time authenticating the earphones from sennheiser, as the QR code on the box doesn't work anymore and the customer care services over the call & mail are Horrible. After wasting cumulatively 3 hours over the phone listening to YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US, PLEASE HOLD THE LINE  and WASTING 4 days, (including sat and sun)  I had given up all the hopes and decided to send the product back to Amazon. But still somehow I convinced myself to keep the earphones ( may be due to the Positive Amazon reviews and my experience with Cx180.I Just hope that I never get a chance to use their warranty services.

"Starting with the package, the box the earphone comes in is very beautiful.Now coming to the earphone itself.Sound quality:Bass is good and of high quality, highs and lows good and overall listening quality is enjoyable.Mic:Crystal clear mic, Works well, very less noise while calling.Comfort:Very comfortable. The earhooks on the back of the ear doesn't seem to hurt in longer usages. The overall weight of the earphones is less and hence is very comfortable

"Sennheiser CX275s is a superb in the ear headset. Sound quality is awesome with clear reach bass. Carry with a synthetic pouch & a 3.5mm connector. Packaging also great. Only cons was wire too thin. Before I used cx180. After 10months used cx180 one-sided earphone was showing defects. I login a complain. I would send that product to sennheiser headquarters. Then they should send a new product to me between 10days. I want say to sennheiser you are No1 brand in the world,  so concentrate on wire quality. Then no any other brand can reach you

"The build quality of the headphones are pretty nice. The wires look very thin and fragile though. Three types of earbuds were provided. The pouch given with the headphones are very useful for carrying the headphones around. Value for money.The jack could have been angled instead of being straight to avoid getting frayed. It hasn't frayed till now though. Very few headphones come with 2 years warranty in this range so that's a plus point.The listening experience is pretty decent. The bass is well balanced. Mic and mic button function very well. The mic works well when its held close to the mouth.

"This is one of the best product at this price point. The sound quality is just amazing. Loved it. Treble is on point. Bass is powerful. Mids are balanced.

"I have been using these headphones for over a year now and there is zero complain on it. the bass of the sound is perfect even the 4D sounds are really cool you can hear them really well. The product comes with three ear buds in different sizes so you can select the one which fits your ear properly. the noise cancellation it is awesome once plugged into your ears it cancels out the sound from out completely and it detangles easily, have a long wire, the microphones are good to communicate hence one could not ask better from earphones.

"I don’t think there is any match for these Sennheiser earphones !!! Absolutely amazing !!!I had an earlier version of these from last 5 years and just because they worn out I had to keep them aside.. I’ve had iPhone’s earpads, audio technica, Sony, Phillips, mi n few others, nothing satisfies as these do. The moment you have them in your ears, it reduces 40% of external noise(remember these are wired earphones).The sound(music, voice, movie) it just heard in your head. Not the ears..,!!
",positive
"The battery life is a little low for my taste. Apart from that, CX 6.00BT are a solid pair of earphones with well built structure and housing for the drivers; they have a wide frequency spectrum with pretty flat sound signature with a little bit of coloring (boosted bass and treble frequencies). Sennheiser’s engineering is yet again proven to be the best. CX 6.00BT may not be a cheap pair of wireless earbuds, but trust the Sennheiser’s reputation and you’ll be surprised by buying these earphones how much well worth Sennheiser’s products are. Sennheiser is a German company, and Germans are known for their engineering skills, even in audio.Note: for people looking for bass heavy earphones, CX 6.00BT should not be one of your choices.
",positive
"Used the earphones for over 7 hours today on a train journey, absolutely no fatigue or any kind of irritation on or in the ears, the large caps provide a snug fit and cancel out external noise to a great extent, the wires look deceptively thin, but can make out it is quality build, reason for 4* & not 5*is because the wires get tangled way too easily and frequently, which is very annoying, also not rating below 4*is purely coz of the worldwide warranty it's not going to WOW at this price range is my personal opinion, definitely more than a good product without doubt, especially comfort level (4.5)update : after 6 months of use, it's sturdy as hell! Definitely worth the money

"The product Sennheiser CX 275 S In -Ear Universal Mobile Headphone With Mic (Black), it claims universal but it dose not support all MOBILE PHONE!! This vital information Amazon or seller has not mentioned anywhere and Pure case of misleading the customer.The Phone which it supports is mentioned in the inside of the packet which is visible only once you open the complete pack.The built quality is very Cheap.As it didn't work with my phone cant comment on voice quality.Total disappointment/worst product/ False claim

"Pros:1. Nice Sound quality (4/5)2. Earphone fits easily (3.5/5)3. Call quality while receiving call is good (4/5)Cons:1. Build quality is not that great because of thin wire. Either it will get cut off or tangled easily, you have to be bit careful(2.5/5) for build qualityOverall  Value for money. You will get best earphone in mid range earphone.

"One of the most regrettable purchases. Sound quality is absolutely horrible. Tested on various sources like 4 different phones, DAP, Headphone amps. Pathetic. Item is only replaceable and not refundable. My friends Mi Piston earphones are way better than this. Very thin and flimsy build to add to the agony.
",negative
"Though on the expensive side of the earphone market,the cx-275s from Sennheiser is one of the most loved and trusted headphones in the segment.Plenty of reasons for this support namely the Amazing Sound Quality from the Earphones,the Good looks of the headphone and German Built.However,the wire is rubberised and may seem fragile to many while the 3.5mm jack connector shouldn't be handled roughly as chances are that the wire may get loose and you may get distorted sound.Overall,a good product with some great audio quality to make you enjoy your moments even more.
",positive
"Sennheiser CX225S has been on my list of earphones to try because of its earpiece design. I love that it's in-ear model and comes with a total of 3 earpieces; small medium and large. I use the small ones. They're very extremely weight and don't seem to weigh the earphones down while they're in use.The mic is pretty much what made me buy this. Quality of sound on call is very good and I majorly only use them for attending calls and watching videos on YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime. They work pretty well for the purpose.Cons:I use a Nokia 8 and these headphones give a constant buzzing noise in calls while the other person on call talks. The little connecter is even worse. Mutes my voice completely on the other side. Consider this if you use a Nokia phone.

"Thump is here....what can I say just buy it and feel the thump sennheiser is like Bose substitute...u won't feel to keep it back just always like to put on and have fun....writting it after 2 years of use and not a single defect wires look sleek but are damn high durable as it used to get entabgled to my bikes handle and boss it still rules over every other earphone in this price range like a thallaiva....GERMAN ENGEERING AT ITS BEST IS WHAT SENNHEISSEER RESEMBLES.

"So I have been using the current pair of CX 275s for more than 6 months now. I use them regularly on my daily commute (of an hour) to work on my bike as well as in the office for Skype calls (which usually means nearly 4-4.5 hours out of the 9 hours at work)The Sound quality is good. However, if you are looking for extra bass then perhaps these may not be where you should be looking at.They are quite comfortable for regular use and the noise-cancellation is quite good at this price point. The 2 year warranty that is provided, makes these the most bang for buck earphones. If ever, you face issues with the earphones as long as they are within the warranty period, replacement is quite hassle free. (Applies to the CX180 as well which I owned earlier as well)To sum it all up, if you are looking for a good pair of multi-purpose earphones for regular use you cannot go wrong with these.
",positive
"CONS:I was a bit skeptical of buying the Sennheiser CX 275 due to the reactions on it's durability. I was correct on that part, the wires are too thin making the device vulnerable to wear and tear (and we are considering to buy a wire protector).PROS:Apart from that we have been blown away with the comfort while listening to media, it does not stress out your ears. Noise cancellation features are true to what they have claimed and the music streaming is the best( true to their reputation)All in all, I am satisfied with the purchase just that need to be a but careful with the product ( cannot be handled as how we really do with our usual earphones)

"IMPORTANT: This earphone is a quality product. Anywhere below ₹1400 it is a great buy. The value does drop below ₹1400 on sale and special occasions.DESCRIPTION:Included with the earphone is a beautiful leather pouch and differently sized earbuds.The bass is good and the audio clear.You may think it is fragile but it will surprise you.The wire is mostly tangle free.Noise cancellation is good too.
",positive
"It is for clarity of sound. Keeping Price in mind - it could be one of the best options. Excellent for calls. Good for Music. It is quite balanced. This is not for Bass lovers at all - about right on all bands. Loudness is perfect. You will probably not need to play it full volume ever.Cable is not sturdy or strong - be careful not for rough use.Apart from that it comes with required stuff - like variable size tips - choose carefully to get Noise Cancellation.Very Light and comfortable - you will not feel it.It has everything that is a sign of great design - L - Shape Connector, Leather Bag.Given the on-the-go use case that this product is primarily for - a Good Sturdy cable is the only thing that I marked it 4 start for - otherwise - it is highly recommended.
",positive
"Definitely this is not for the base lovers. Very low base sometimes not that too. Not loud. I have to increase the audio level to 70% and higher to hear it well. Even a low range earphone can perform well compared to this. Please don't buy it. I even doubt on its originality. I used cx275 previously which was too good and this one is terrible.
",negative
"Don't think these are suitable to working out but are pretty good for general lifestyle usage. The wire is long but is meant to only stretch upto an extent, do NOT test its durability. Sound and mic quality is pretty good, I've been using it for 2 years almost and quality is still brilliant.The silicon ending of the earphone might break but it's not noticeable, the important problem is that the earbuds fall off when you use it a lot as it becomes looser, you get a replacement back (although different sizes only) so that's good.I'd say if you're looking for cheap, good earphones with a mic, this is the one.

"Worst.  For 1700 this is a crap. Can think to buy for Rs. 699. Poor bass genuinely there is no bass.  And there is no option for return . Replacement of the same product nonly available. Disappointed totally.

"Have been using this earphone for the past 10 days. For me, this ticks all the boxes, perfect sound quality, light weight, good fit and in ear comfort. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a daily use earphone.Only drawback is that no pouch came along this. Last year I had purchases the previous version of the sennheiser earphone and it came with a good pouch, but this one even though double the cost, did not have a carry pouch.. otherwise the product is great.

"If it falls in your budget, get it. That's all there is to it.I was restricting my budget to 900 because I have never felt the need for an expensive earphone despite my dialy use,so I kept pushing my purchase of the 275 for 3 years. Finally I decided to get it and it's great. I loved the cx 180 and this is even better. Very crisp,clear and decent noise masking. It's light,it's comfortable. It's got a mic that makes superb calls. I don't think you can beat this ,despite the premium over the JBL c100SI

"Sennheisers are meant for the production of perfect sound. These aren't for bass listeners. These are only for high fidelity sound listeners. I am using Sennheiser since 5 years firstly CX 180, then CX 3.00, and now CX 2.00G. These have a perfect flat sound response. Has High Treble, Balanced Bass.The only issue is that they are very sensitive to humidity, sweat, and water. I had kept them in my front pocket in the humid climate in Mumbai. The one side that encountered sweat, or humidity and sounded a little low. But got replaced in the Service Center. Just be cautious while using it and prevent it from any type of water or sweat. Their service centers are only big cities in India, and getting them replaced is a tedious task. Sennheiser please note this issue that these earphones are very prone to water. I had used CX 3.00 and they did not have this problem (by the way I had put them in Washing Machine thrice) but the sound was not affected a bit and lasted more than 3 years (after which its wire got torn). So for the sound, these are perfect, but only if you prevent it from water.

"I was really confused before purchasing...as there are many reviews ..for cx275s...bt this one had better base and sound quality...also...there is volume ctrl remote...so I went for this one.And...now I feel...my gut feeling really paid well...this one is just absolutely fantastic. Balanced sound...decent treble...and bass. Base is on the heavier side. Overall audio quality is just amazing.I purchased this 5 days after getting cx180...which I didnt like ..as the treble was too piercing. Go for this one if you want some bass backed music...with balanced treble.

The wire is so thin I'm having doubts about the durability of the product .. (since it's about 1700 the product should have be gud ( should have given a breaded cable))2.Bass is not enough i think (considering the price).Overall the best earphones u can but if u can look past the thin wire and not enough bass .

"I like the clarity of these headphones. Noise cancellation works best if there is a good seal between your ear cavity and the head phones. However, this tends to prevent air circulation within the ear for me. I found this air tight feeling to be uncomfortable. Hence, I usually wear these headphones with some clearance so that air can flow freely into the ear cavity. However, this results in reduced noise cancellation properties. Overall, these are a good bunch of headphones!

"This is my second Sennheiser ear phone where the volume has gone down significantly within 4 months of buying the product. I have tried to contact the service center multiple times but no one picks up the phone. Will not recommend this product to anyone.

"i bought it on 7th march 2015 and i am very much impress by the quality of sound and bass.after use of more than 3 year sound quality remained same as 1st day of use only thing observed that wire covering got few cracks bcz of wear and tear. (after rough use)thats y i was looking for new headset to buy, done some days in r & d about headset.but again found these headset are still the king of headset in this price range.....so bought them again now in 2018...hats off to Sennheiser...🙌🙌🙌if you have budget of 1.5k then go for these and if its under 1k then go for cx180(under 800 with same quality) without a doubt but u have to compromise with mic.dont thing just go for it...

"The overall sound experience is very gud. This is completely balanced for Bass and terrible. You'll experience all the details. This is been six months i am using it. The best part is few days back it was having some issue so i went to sennheiser Service center and they replaced it immediately. I am very happy for their service. I do recommend to all if anybody love music they can go ahead with product, may be you'll say the price of this product  is a bit higher than other brands but i would say quality and service of this brand is best. A big thanks to Sennheiser.

"First of all,  I love the design of the earbuds, very unique. I was using Sennheiser CX180 before this and they worked perfectly for two years no issue at all. Jst that they didnt have a mic so I got these. They are very comfortable and sound quality is great, balanced. Only the cable is too thin, looks fragile it was like that on CX180 too and nothing happened to that so i dont think it will be a problem.I ordered one and after using for a day i realized the mic wasnt working properly and the button also didnt respond sometimes, but i got it replaced and now no issue with it. :)

"The sound is absolutely superb for this price. No complaints. ALSO a superb faux leather pouch free with it!Cons:The plug is a straight one, instead of a 90° bent one. So it'll definitely be kinked there and prone to break.The wires are very thin and round. Feels very flimsy. I don't know how long it'll last. I'd recommend some wire protectors.The in ear plugs are just okay. Not too happy about the shape and size of it.

"I'm writing this review after about 6 months of use.Material quality:The build quality of this product isn't on par with with some other products at this price range as the wires are thin and unbraided which often causes them to get entangled pretty easily.Durability:After 6 months there is normal wear and tear which also depends upon individual use but they are working just fine.Sound quality:The most important one for most of us,so the sound quality is what made me fall in love with these earphones.They're just perfect for my taste as the bass isn't that intense and the mids and lows are just on spot.To sum up:It's a pretty decent pair of earphones for their price with great sound and average build quality.I say go for it.Ps: if you are confused between jbl's earphones and this one,just go for these as they sound much better

"These are incredible Headphones. I had bought a one three years back. There is hardly any damage to the headphones. I use them for taking calls, listening to music, working out, etc and they seem to hold ground everywhere.The buds fit snugly into the ear and the headphone doesn't slip even when working out.The music quality is excellent.The bass is punchy and not super thumping. The mids and highs are balanced. I used songs like Jumbalika, Thriller, etc to test them and you can feel the different instruments distinctly.Recently I had wanted to buy new ones and found that these stand in comparison to 1More Dual Driver and Boat Nirvana Tres Headphones in most features.I'm quite satisfied with this buy.

"Many audio enthusiasts have been scouting for good BT earphones, but JBL and Sony have dissapointed at the lower end. Most of the big names have been too busy amping up the battery or range. So I'll keep this about sound quality only, as the range and battery life is as good as the others. Many reviews have been too critical about the ''lack of Bass' but let me assure you that these beauties produce 90% of the sound signature of the Sennheiser 275, which is a huge compliment for a BT Earphone in this class. Since the bass is not overpowering, the mids and highs are crisp and clear  , resulting in true sound. Yes, the drums and bass guitar is nowhere as booming as on Sony XB55AP, but it is just good enough for Knopfler or Gilmour's guitar to sound true. While I love the Bose Truly Wireless buds sound (sans the audio lag!), I found this close to Bose Soundsport BT performance at half the cost.Bottomline: If you're a Sennheiser loyalist, you won't be dissapointed at this price point. They are light, don't feel much, fit right and have awesome build quality.  These are the best BT earphones I've heard under 10k.

"I received my earphones today and although this review might be a little preemptive, I felt it was necessary to put in a word to address some concerns that potential buyers might have. One of the first concerns I had was if the product was fake; because a few other reviewers pointed to the same. As soon as I received the package, I went to the Sennheiser website to make sure that my product was genuine. It was, indeed. My primary concern allayed, I opened the package and I was very happy with everything. You get a 3.5mm adapter, extra ear buds, a pouch, and a manual. The earphones themselves are just fantastic, I tested them quite rigorously today and they held up very well. The bass is not extraordinary, but it's very good quite frankly speaking and unless you're an obsessive audiophile, you shouldn't be disappointed with the sound. The build quality is good, they don't feel cheap. I played a range of music, from your Bollywood numbers to trance to hip-hop to death metal to Djent even and found that the sound was quite good and enjoyable. At decent volumes, these earphones shut the world out and immerse you in the music completely. At the price, these earphones are a steal. I'll continue to use these and revise my review if they ever fall short of expectations.

"prior to this earphones i have used JBLT150A, Sony MDR-EX150AP, Sennheiser CX 180  all of them were good products which lasted 2 years  except JBLT150 which i had to replace after 6 months. i tested Sennheiser CX 275 when my friend bought it and i knew which earphone would be my next daily driver. Its audio quality was great in all freq ranges whether its low, high or mid it was engineered perfectly. biggest con of the earphone is its build quality the wires are too thin and could be damaged easily for a rough user it will brake easily(for such user i would suggest to go for something with kevlar,flat or braided wires ) i consider myself a rough user i would fell asleep with my earphones on plugging it on either phone or my laptop. it finally took a tall on it. it started tearing of on joints and and other parts were it usually bend or gets tangled today its left driver stopped working due to damage on the wire. it  worked perfectly fine for 2years which is great considering its thin wires.

"Believe me guys, these are way better than Skullcandy method earbuds. I bought these because my methods worn off. I was a little skeptical about these, but after listening to just one song, I could tell the difference between my Skullcandy methods and these. The bass is good, treble is good, it just ticks all the boxes for me.Just that I could be a little cheaper. 2345/- is a bit too much for this model (because it is not the latest one). Overall, if you can buy these, surely go them.

"A review by a sound enthusiast.Awesome Sound quality of mids and treble, clear and pleasent treble , smooth and soft mids but one needs to equalize the freqencies a bit for that perfect balance of mids and trebl.andNeodynamium magnet - So Active BASS outputBass is preset low by default on this but..This earphone has capability to produce Bass more then your ears can handle  but to produce that much of bass a custom audio driver is required.to play low and ""feel the pressure"" of this frequency one needs an audio driver which amplifies this frequency range.Mobile phones doesn't have this amplification....and cannot be done much with an equalizer from playstore.So dont judge this on its default low bass setting.One con is wire is too thin.. and can easily break. Other then that an awesome earphone in every aspect except thin wire.

"First things first, this is not a noise cancellation earphone. It's runner plugs keep outside sound from reaching the ear drums. These reproduce sound as close as possible to the source without modifying it. Although the wires look thin they are strong enough to bear daily tugs and snags, and won't break easily. No nonsense reliable earphones that are a reliable workhorse of ear phones.

"I purchased it in February 2018 and there is a two years of warranty also on this. Its one speaker not working after 9 month onwards. Upon sending complain to Sennheiser, they said please come to Gurugram service centre from Noida just for repair. Even they dont have facility of picking up this article. Such purchase is not good for people who are staying in Noida/Ghaziabad as they will suffer a lot after the problem arises in product. Once they sell it, they dont care about customer and talk anything but they dont know that those are the customers who will never come back to purchase it again, neither they will recommend any one.

"It's been just over 2 months since I purchased these headphones.. good balanced sounds, with good clarity.. even while on call. The overall pitch is higher than Bose, but the sound quality is almost the same.. Bass is not punchy, likeable. Highs, mids and lows are very well balanced, you can hear every note and instrument in the background. Can be a suitable alternative to Bose in ear wired headphones. The only place where Bose notches up is in the reproduction of overall sound, which gives a surround sound like feel.. and no doubt more clearer sounds. But this still is a good and cheaper alternative

"Review post using this earphones after a weekGo for it !!!!!My highlights with priorities for this earphones:1. Thump : more than enough thump for the beats which also produces a more than decent amount of bassA kick-ass hearing experience. For that if you could adjust little bit of your equalizer well from internal setting then it will be with you for sure2. Clearly awesome in highs n lows n mids as well .. again make proper equalizer even if you don't do it its there ..sound quality is just there3. Vocals - if there are more than a person singing a song at a time . Trust me you can hear both the voices clearly along considering above 2 points (bass, highs, lows and mids)4. Best fit in the ear - small and light weight so you don't have to adjust now n thenSome improvement areas -Need to give promising build qualityWires are very thin but decent to useEarbuds given are not that comfortable so I replaced them with my old ones

"The model and the sound quality is is on par excellence. The moment i saw these headphones and plugged them in, there wasn’t any resistance in inserting them. The angled design gives a great comfort that my ears aren’t irritated anymore and I have spent hours and hours listening to songs before my ears start crying from pain caused by the structure of the buds. This for one has two variants and I wasn’t aware that one supports the android and the other iOS.The reason behind cost difference between both of them is an unknown fact on my side and hence I chose the wrong OS headset since I use Apple. That may be the downside on my part and the length of the wire is an issue which in turn gets intertwined with each other and I seriously fear that because of this I might not utilise the product’s life.Altogether put it’s a great product and if you’re looking for Android CX2.00G is your model and CX2.00i is your iOS variant. Be cautious and order accordingly, unlike me.

"Ordered product on early september 2018, delivery was timely as usual. After approximately 6 months of use, here's what I observed.PROS1. Sound quality is really good. Covers frequency ranging from 10 hz. to 15,000 hz. Means, excellent bass, and remarkable treble sounds.2. The mouthpiece, or the mic, is also really good. I have found that the clarity at the other end is pretty good even when I am riding a bike @60kmph, which brings me to another point3. I occasionally listen to songs on this earphone while riding bike, and I have to tell you, noise cancelation is phenomenal.4. Another good thing I noted about this piece is that, while you are on a call and you speak on the mic, the earpiece gives you a feedback of your voice. In other words, you can hear yourself speak on the earpiece, which I found to be an interesting quirk. Reason being, in most of the noise cancelation earphones, you can't hear your voice, except for a deep rumbling on your chest (try speaking with your fingers plugging your ears)CONS1. Well, the wire noise is a bit turn off. Could have been better, but it is not too much to complain about anyway.2. Now this one really gets me. The left and right earpieces are reverse! From a brand like Sennheiser, this simply is negligence. Now, this doesn't make much of difference to someone who does not really care about where the sound is coming from, but for music lover like myself, this is a bummer. Your favorite song does not sound, well, like it should.But then, you can always switch your ears... Put left on right and right on left. That fixes everything, and there is no discomfort in your ears if you do so.But still...Anyway, a 4 star from my side. Fix the left right issue, and its a 5 star product.

"Writing this review after I used it for more than 3 years. So consider reading the complete review.First the cons:1. Wire is a bit thin. But very smooth to handle.2. If not kept in a proper case, it'll take you few seconds to unwind.3. None other that I know of.Pro:1. Highly durable if you care enough for the things you use.2. The 2 years warranty is something. If you find the music is not as good as when it was new due to some issue in earbuds, return (courier or in person) it to the Sennheiser guys. Provided it is physically undamaged, they will hand you over a new one.3. Noise cancellation is optimum. Pedestrians must avoid using it if in heavy road traffic.4. Awesome music quality. You can actually distinguish between different frequencies and different instruments that has be used. Mid and high frequencies sounds crisp. Bass could have been better. Ofcourse you mustn't compare the quality with the ones you get with 3k-4k bucks.5. Use it for long hours, I mean really long time, still you won't find  anything uncomfortable with you ears. Can be used comfortably while you're sleeping in you bed.6. Though I don't have prior experience using any big company earphone products, I had bought it after researching all the products/reviews available online. Believe me I'll again go for this if I had to buy a new one. The best in this price segment.

"I am a person who commute most days, 6 hours up and down in train. So music of all geners and movies from around the world occupy most of my journey time, all these years. So to listen to music and watch movies without fatigue and noise of the train is very much important for me. To put in short, this ear phone is neutral. Sound quality of this ear phone is  very good. Those who love neutral sound (which is the best option to listen to all types of music), can very well opt for this. Sound equilibrium from high freequency to low without distortions is well maintained. (I can give u a tip to check your audio listening devices. Play ""Bohemian Rhapsody by queen. The song covers all most all freequency levels, with different vocals and instruments.)  No sickening high bass. Those who love thumping bass may opt for other ear phones.But....... This product is not worth what it costs. The same quality of Sound can be obtained from a JBL  C100SI earphone as well (Durabilty of the mentioned JBL product is below average. I couldnt even use it for one year)  but it costs only half the price of this  product. I cant say anything about durability at this moment, since i bought this just one day back only.Hoping for the best...

"It has been more than 3 years since I bought this headphone. Iam completely satisfied with it. But one side of the headphone has stopped working now and Iam thinking of buying a new one. I have been contemplating for a while but could not think of any other product than this one. If Iam going to buy a new one, it will be the same model. For any headphone, 3 years is a good span and Iam sure that if we protect the portion near the plug from being worn out, it will definitely last much longer. Usually in any headphone , one side of it stops working because the wire near the plug portions gets worn out with time.

It is also delivers good performance while playing music, bass is soothing and not very high. To compare, I also have Sony WI-C400 in-ear headphones but it gives poor audio, inspite of comfort of neckband i have to forgo it for sake of voice clarity on wired Sennheiser CX 275.

"These are pathetic earphones for such a high price. I bought them after seeing good reviews but ended up feeling bad for taking a bad decision of buying them.

After not more than a month of use, microphone is not working. Dealing with Senheiser Customer care now. Don't go for these ear phones. There is a reason why they are selling for 2.5k while the MRP of product is 4.5K. Because they are bad performing. Don't buy them.

But after 6 months of usage, I observed a volume difference between the two ear buds. This is something that is damaging for the ear. No one would recommend using such a product. Sennheiser should really look into the product's performance in longer term(more than 6 months). If the product is not able to deliver as promised after 6 months, then it should be mentioned in the product's description.

"Bought it on May this year, now it's completely damaged from the inside even though it looks good from the outside. When the earphone is connected, it turns the volume up and down on it's own, plays or pauses the songs automatically and opens apps (especially Google assistant) on it's own. I thought it was a virus at first but after thorough scanning with different anti- viruses with no signs, I realized that it was indeed my earphone that was actually messing around with my smartphone. Also the sound quality was not worth right from the start (maybe I received a defective piece). It had more trebel and hardly any  bass. Even when I set my equaliser to bass boost, the bass quality was not that great. Infact the cx180 I had before sounded better than this.

So if you are a bass lover then may be its not a perfect choice for you.Also, the mic is not that good and i have to keep it very near to my mouth then only the other person can hear me properly.

"Very good product.. very balanced sound, not very bass heavy... But a very balanced sound output... Battery life is also decent...

"This here is the best of Sennheiser products. It's comfortable. it's got a microphone jack with call answer/pause/play button. It's sleek and easy to carry around. If you use it for at least 2-3 hours per day, every day, these will last 1-2 years depending of the nature of your use. Sometimes, rough handling can cause issues. I had my first pair for 2 years and now, I'm using my second pair..

"Regularly normal pop music plays good. Without any enhancements.But, while playing done instrumental, and old Rock, some guitar solos only sound from left side, and other vocals from right, takes a little bit of time till it gets equalised. & whatever I do it won't get fixed.Wire quality is very flimsy, might break any moment.Worthless for ₹1400Not at all recommended.

"Product review-It has very well balanced sound,dont expect for high bass.Highs & Mids sound is clear and sharpBass is not too high,but very well balancedPerfect experience too watch movies and play gamesOnly the con is build quality of the earphoneAmazon delivery -I ordered it by prime,and it was delivered by one day.But the product was fake and tampered,even the pouch was missing and seal was open.Plz be aware of it before purchasingLater amazon replaced the product within 2 daysI was than provided by the original product which i had ordered .

"I am looking for a replacement of the product, within six /6 months, a piece broke of the mouth where you attach it to the phone & stayed stuck inside it so that I couldn't put or use any other earpiece even in place of your Seinheiser one for long time till I could take it to a repair hub where they removed it, but as it is broken, can't use it anymore, how is this possible that a high-end claimed to be high quality earpiece costing about 1500 bucks breaks within few months? Please arrange for a replacement ASAP immediately without fail from the company's side.

"Best pair of earphones used till date.Sound quality is excellent. Vocals clear.A beginner's option for people who prefer vocals over bass.Noise cancellation isn't the best but it does its job.You would definitely be disappointed if you go for these expecting bass. Its only flaw.Mine lasted for 2 good years on everyday use and then one of side just died so that's what you need to expect.

"the ear buds fit well, complete noise cancelation, perfect high, lows and mids. (buzz with ac/dc, led zeppelin, edm, trance, and oh dubstep, rock, metal, bass etc.. it delivers the punch everytime)  no burn in time required  (tweak your equalizer for custom sound of how you like it)  bass point on. mic picks up sound so well and the clarity of the sound other person hears is beyond any inbox mic headphones I've used.  cord is a bit thin kinda like audio technica thin, but it'll last long it seems.  the pouch /carry bag is superb. verify authenticity online and get the best part of 2yrs warranty.highly recommended for people with headphones dying every six months or so.  a good investment (2k is worth it. as 2yrs warranty)

"First I would like to say that, there is sound quality& bass v/s any headphones with loud sound. I had used sennheiser few years back, after that I started experimenting with  other brands also like, Sony, JBL, Boat, Philips and even some local brand also but I never quite got that satisfaction which I used to get from Sennheiser.Great sound clarityNice bass,PERFECT FIT, And I mean it. Sennheiser fits just perfectly in my ears and doesn't fall out, neither does my ears pain if I use it for long time.Product quality is decent.Microphone is pretty normal just like any other headphones.

"Good clarity, however low on bass, sometimes a little metallic, quite hardy I must say cause I dropped it twice and there was absolutely no damage to the earphones. A little over-priced consider the Sony ones come within 1K. Overall a good deal.

"I purchased this earphone a few days back and firstly the product that was delivered to me was defective.I replaced the same and it was delivered to me the next day itself.However the replacement is now not working properly and mic is also not responding.I feel cheated twice after such an experience.Will have to consider whether to shop again from Amazon.

"Pros: (Everything under this price range).1. Sound quality.2. Best bass.3. Call answering button along with mike. Which also got options to play/pause, Next song in your MP3 player.Cons.1. Wire quality: very thin2. No volume up/down button, they given in higher end. Just for this paying extra bugs is not worth.

As much as you are tempted to buy them, DON'T!Even audio technical clr100 & JBL c150 si sounds mcuh better than these.I  extremely Regret buying these

"Sound quality is perfect in both low and high volumes also well equipped with bass. but paying such a price i also demand better built quality. it seems very fragile and even the cord is not tangle free on which i compromised. it is not a complete package i would say so if you are going to get this one you have to compromise on some of the aspects.

"First of all, I love Sennheiser. There's no one better in the game when it comes to audio equipments. Earphones are very durable. These have been in washing machine like 5-6 times now (mistakenly). But I just take them out and leave them for drying for 1-2 days and they are back to normal. Cord has been pulled numerous time. Twice, I thought no way these could survive through this much pulling force. But, I underestimated it. I got these as an upgrade from CX 180 after using them for 3 years. I recommend these.

"keep in mind to turn the volume dial down....these thing is scary loudand more scary when you add a portable amplifier with it............and for the ones who need a flat tone... don't mind taking it.....just tweak the equaliser to vocal or more mids and high to nullify the bassy side of it. loved the scary volume

"A great product from Sennheiser..Review after usage of 1.5 year.Pro: Good sound quality. Smooth base. Good material for rough use.Cons: mic quality is not that much on voice calling.But when using recoder it's good.Small sound from call button.After 1.4 year use the left ear piece stopped working.I send the fault product to the Sennheiser service center.They replace the fault product with brand new one.Great service from Sennheiser team..

"I could not find any headphones at this price range or below which provides awesome sound quality. But the wires are so delicate and if not handled carefully, there are greater chances of the wire being damaged. Been using it the past 1 year and after 8 months, the left earpiece stopped working. But was able to claim warranty without any hassle. Just make sure to buy it from reputated sellers to avoid getting non authentic one's.

"Sennheiser CX 275 are the best wired headphones available. The concentration is more on the quality of midrange output rather than ear deafening bass. One can put on these and listen for hours without any fatigue. Bass heavy headphones cause ear fatigue. The quality of sound gives you the opportunity to listen to those notes in your fav songs which you may have never been able to listen on a regular cheap bass heavy headphones.

Bass is decent ( only if u r not a bass lover)Cons-1. Wire quality is poor. U can get much better wires in jbl n others.2. Doesn't fits in the ear perfectly. Overall I wud say it's good for those who r not a much music lover but if u are,  then go for some other brands bcoz it might disappoint u.

"Product Related:Pros:1) High quality sound (Bass-Trebal-Mids are optimally set)2) intricate design with good packaging.3) Microphone is highly receptive and sound quality is good.4) Plays well with all types of music and adjusts to the variations very quickly.Cons:1) Very very delicate. Try to mess with it will get damaged.2) Extremely thin wires makes it tangle easily.3) cannot distinguish left and right (maybe anyone can be used I presume)4) Cannot be used in extremes (running, gym-ing etc) - I fear of damaging it as it's so delicate.Amazon Service: One word for it - Amazing!!!

"Awesome earphones I have ever used. I am big fan of music and high quality sound fascinates me. For me, compromising sound quality is a big deal. But, this product lives upto my expectations and beyond that! After using this earphone, I don't feel like using any other products. It's my 4th year with this earphone (of course I lost my previous one and had to order the same product!) and it does not disappoint me any day. Highly recommended for music lovers at this price which I think is quite affordable.

"Sound quality is excellent for this price range.i have compared it with other similar range head phones. I can't say that built quality is that good.everything is from plastic,but it won't hinder the sound quality.the wire could have been of a bit more thick and tangle free material.overall the product met my expectations.

"When I first tried these ear buds, I did not have them far enough inside the ear and the sound was very tinty.This morning, I seemed to have placed the buds further into my ears and the quality of the sound improved 1,000 fold.The size of the rubber ear pieces is extremely important. The bass seems absent unless the buds are fully inside ear. The only downside I see is the lack of volume control and ability to switch tracks when listening to music. Hope to have provided a helpful review.

"Quality of sound is not as good as Sony XB55 or even Samsung's inbox in-earphones. As volume is levelled up above 70% sound quality starts getting rediculous. Cable quality is unacceptable. It is quiet easy to get damged. At this price consumer should not focus on brand name rather focus on quality of sound. Moreover, it doesn't not have volume rockers keys.

"Hey there, I am using this earphones with My Iphone 6s plus and so far it’s been a good experience. The only problem with these earphones is that You can never hear it with volume full and they are very delicate. The problem with sound it that Your ears will bleed, as it’s sound quality is not good at full but yes if you keep it with volume at 75% it will give you an Awsome sound experience which you’ll love. At this price-range it’s a good deal. 4/5 rating for it’s sound quality at this price.

"I've been using Soundmagic ES18 for about past 6 months and I find it very good value for money headphones.The Sennheiser cx275s is also  a  very good value for money headphones ,a little more stylish than the SoundMagic ES18 .Sennheiser cx275s sounds really good, even though the bass is very power it is clear and  not overpowering. You can hear sound of each and every instrument clearly.The quality of these headphones are very good and it supports mic also. When compared to the SoundMagic ES18 you can go on hearing bass overwhelmed songs for hours and it doesn't hurt your ears but SoundMagic ES18 starts hurting after sometime. These headphones also comes with a warranty of 2 years.Finally these headphones are real value for money under rupees 1500.

"Fulfilled by Amazon, so packaging was good. It came in a compact packing. Quality of the audio was good.. noise cancellation was decent, though I didn't test it much except for listening to music in front of the TV or somebody talking. You can take calls and end calls with the call button. It is the only single button present there. Voice quality is average and it was snubbing the voice a bit. On the main screen if you press the button, it would open the default music player and starts playing a song. If you press again, it will pause it. It is capable of capturing FM radio signals. This is tested on Samsung S3 as a headset. On apple ipad as a headphone. The volume up down buttons were not present. While some commented that it is thin (and it is compared to my stock Samsung headphone), it is not fragile.

"This is genuinely one of best earphone I have ever bought. It's perfect from every angle. Being a music lover, I enjoy listening music by using this earphone very much.

"This is my second purchase from seinnheiser brand . Previous one was cx180. So I can campare new one with that.  Sound quality is Almost same no big difference. Bass is on louder side in cx275. I heard Sony also but I think cx 275is better than Sony. nothing more special beside attached mic in cx 275. I will rewrite my review after using it for some weeks.Thanks

"I don't know why this product got that much good reviews, i listen for 1 or 2 hours with all the kind of sounds and finally i got to know that at this cost we can get 2 earphones with better sound. This earphone has very bad sound quality like some local product that we can get in trains of cost 50 to 100 rs only.  I really disappointed with this product.I was using sony c300 bluetooth earphone, if someone want to listen good sound just try that and compare, you will got to know.

"sound quality is good. bass and treble balance is adequate. its priced slightly on the higher side may be because of its looks and brand name. I would suggest to them to cut about 200-300 bugs on it if they want to steal the costumers away from other brands. As such one cannot see the design once they are in your ears. Built quality is good and they provide a small pouch with it to stow your earphones which is handy as it prevents it from tangling if kept just like that.
",positive
"Pls do not buy this product.Sound is honestly good and clear, though bass is not as per expectations.Product material quality is not good at all. I read some reviews around the quality, however I thought it is to do with user handling. But when I experienced it myself, I regret buying this product. It is a very delicate, which is unexpected for headphone kind of product. And this happens within 2 months of purchase

"Build quality does not feel premium. I feel the wires are delicate. Sony earphones are better choice if you're looking for durable products. Sound is well balanced, high and low are clear. Vocals are clear. Clarity in sound. But if you're an EDM lover you might want to look at a different product because this earphone has sacrificed bass for clarity and balanced audio.

"I am using this earphone since Oct 18. I saw many review about wire thickness but I didn't find any problem with that sound quality is good same as cx 213 overall good product.

"I love Music with some bass. Sennheiser CX 2.0G is good over all . Nice soothing sound, comfortable, you can distinguish almost each cord and beat. But one thing it lacks Bass, Bass is just better than phone speaker.  If you are not Bass lover then its awesome earphone in 2K.  I found wire may not sustain longer life and it's also not tangle free. thats a disappointment taking other earphones available in this range.

"For first few days i was really disappointed. The headphones sounded cheap. I actually thought to go for sony again. But after a week suddenly it started to sound great. Bass is good and punchy but not at all overpowering. Treble is fine. Vocals are very very clear. Well it is not comparable to my previous headphone ie sony mdr xb70.but  it is good and very comfortable. Surround sound is quite good and noise cancellation works ok, though i felt that the sound is tweaked in some places and certainly is not for a purist. But, overall at this price this is really a good headphone.

"Amazing sound quality, clear and punchy bass. Good mids. And treble that doesn't bleed your ears! Light to use and comfortable for prolonged use as well. Low impedance, thus low power draw and loud volume. Inline mic is good quality, for calls only tough! Comes with a carrying pouch, do use it! It is not completely tangle free, but is fine.

"Initially the sound quality and voice quality were great.  But within 6 months one of the speakers stopped working.  And amazon doesn't give 1 year warranty,  the brand does.  So,  have to visit customer care of Sennheiser.  Makes you think to buy such products offline rather than online.

"Usually plug type earphones don't give much bass which is standard for all brands not matter how big or small. I, however, was pleasantly surprised by the bass. I wasn't looking forward to it much while buying since I know plugs aren't effective bass wise. It's great. I also have another  Sennheiser, same-ish specifications but they aren't plugs, and this one does a 10% better job than that.PS: I'm a Sennheiser lad so my review may be baised (or not). But they are just better than expensive Sony (bass reflex) etc that I've used in the past.

"This headphone is having really very Good sound (Clear and crispy) it doesn't have rich bass.The one who love normal sound without any rich bass and equalizer they will find this awesome.This headphone is having very good noice cancellation.Just you need to take care of wire which is very thin.Box packing is really good.

"This is my 4th sennheiser product over the years and I really like its sound quality, not exactly as the premium Sennheiser headphones which deliver a unique sound. This one is bassier. Small, extremely light weight and a microphone that works well. Although I feel its not durable due to the plasticky built but nothing happened so far.
",positive
"If what you want is quality sound with well differentiated mids and highs and a moderate amount of bass, Not overpowering, but the right amount for a song as such. Then get this. Not for extra bass lovers. The fit is a little bit tricky to insert as well because of the unconventional shape of the headsets. But what matters is the sound quality, The latency is almost non existent on the microphone button, atleast on my phone anyway. No microphonics at all during normal usage and during walking. This is probably the only headset where i did not rely on the music player inbuilt equaliser to modify the sound signature. That speaks about the sound reproduction on the Sennheiser headsets.
",positive
"First of all i wanted to say that Sennheiser customer care service is awesome they just replace your product if it didn't have any physical damage., Very rare company replace your defective product hand to hand in just 2 3 minutes.I think this cx275 s have some mic issue other people did complaint that your voice is not clear.

"I have bought the earphone and faced issue of mirophone. Even after replacing the earphone facing the same issue.

"Great set of earphones. The sound quality is beautiful. Unfortunately, sennheiser has compromised on the build quality of the earphones. A few months down the line, one side has stopped working. The 3.5mm plug in is really flimsy and the wire is poor. You pay a lot of money and end up with poor quality. It's disappointing. The sound, however, is wonderful. If only the build quality was better.

"It's a steal deal as you get much more than what you pay for. The sound quality is great. The set's design is also excellent!

I must say that the durability of sennheiser earphones is marvellous as I tried using the skullcandy earphones before and they wouldn't survive for even  last 3 months. After the first listen to a song, I could make out how the bass is boosted in the 275s and the notes as super clear. So happy! Totally worth the money. And I'm glad I upgraded to this. I'm a total sennheiser fan!

"I bought this earphones to replace my original iPhone 7 Plus earphones. They are just amazing and too comfortable to use all day long without hurting your ears. The sound quality is very good.

"Not much noisy. Neat sound and comfortable earbuds. I have been using this product an year approx. no problem. I shred this it to my pocket everyday when I go office. Wire quality is also good.

"This is a below average product from Senheiser. Expected more from them. Totally let down. If you enjoy good sound quality sound- DO NOT BUY this product. You’re better off with a (can’t believe I’m actually saying this) BOAT earphones. Even they have a more balanced sound profile than the CX.This was bad. Really bad. Expectations were let down. Days were made to crap.Don’t buy this.

"I have used every piece of headphones But man im gonna really appreciate these the most.Don't think twice to buy this.Better than skull jbl sony and many others available on amazon.Price JustifiedQuality AmazingTotally Worth Buying.. ✌

"Although its seem material quality is descent but, it is robust in nature, no wear and tear problemSound quality is awesome, it's a balanced sound come mid high low, all are balancedIt's a 2 year warranty, so no worry about it.Mic quality is crisp, clear and loud.

"Got them for traveling since I couldn't take my Audio Technicas along with me, they sound great, bass isnt that strong.I've heard a lot about Sony's and their bass response. I personally couldn't get hands on a pair so I can't compare but no matter what you listen, in my experience bass is important.I'll recommend these to someone with a budget of under Rs 2000, but try to listen to Sony's once as I've heard their better before purchasing.Shipping is horrible, took more than a week. Unless amazon is the cheapest, buy from somewhere else. Amazon does has an excellent return service and they accept returns if you are not satisfied by the quality, used this to try different earphones and this pair is what I'm keeping.

"Sound is awesome! I used it for 2 years. The wire is thin. It started to peel off recently. May be it's due to my heavy rugged use. A great product but.I'll buy this again.

"Mind blowing shipping by Amazon. Delivered to me 2 days before the estimated date.The product is absolutely tremendous. Sound quality is beautiful. I'm writing this just after listening to the product. Call button is very sturdy. I've been a Hardcore Sony user. Love Sony for detail in the sound. But this baby impressed me a lot. First ever Sennheiser product & it is absolute magnificent. Very light in the ear. Can't even feel if its there. Bass is really really good. Pouch given with it is a quality product. I use it for EDM mainly & it does the job perfectly.

"Sound is very good, product also good but I don't know why right ear phone is not working.... This shows how much durability and quality of it this product. Very unhappy to share this. Given 2 years warranty. Need to be sent to Bengaluru. Its been irritating.
",negative
"Nice product with completely packed. Sound effect is outstanding compared to other ear phone. Bass quaility is really good. Compatible with most of the smart phones. Great product from Amazon with nice packing. If you are looking for some real sound effects, you should go for it. I am recommending this product over other models line CX 180 and CX 215 because it comes with mic also which is very useful.

"Sound is fantastic.Plastic body and the wire are durable and light weight.I didn't not like the ear buds. Among 3 pairs,I felt the 2 larger sizes are almost the same.

"Points for material quality-3 out of 5,sounds quality-4.5/5.0,durability 4/5. Conclusion:- must buy for bass lover. Clarity of sound is good but not best. Good for this price range:)

"I bought it in April 2017. It worked well for the past 2 years but now recently the mic stopped working. And since the warranty period is now over I am forced to buy a new earphone. Probably will now go for a cheaper one.
",negative
"Good pair of headphones. If you want something that work for a whole year, go ahead and buy these. If you're looking for something that lasts a but longer, look elsewhere.They sound great for the one year that they're going to last for. I had bought 2 of these. One for me and one for my girlfriend. Both of them went bad in a year.

"I brought this item during lightning deal (around 1350).I have used Skullcandy ink'd and Skullcandy inkd'2 (too much treble and suppressed mids) in the past and i can safely say that these earphones are far superior to those in terms of balanced sound.Pros:1.These have a nice soundstage (9/10)2.Just the right amount of lows, mids, and highs (10/10).3.Noise cancellation on these is extremely good (9.5/10)4.Universal mic (comes with a converter if doesn't work directly with your mobile)5.If you are looking for very good bass, you'll love these (9.5/10).Cons:1.The cables look and feel fragile.My current equipment - these and Audio Technica M50X.

"Great sound quality, best part is that it totally blocks any outside noise, delight to use even on airplanes. Pouch provided but would have been best to have a wire manager.
",positive
"What can I tell about the product.I initially ordered the product and got it replace because it was not working properly.Later I ordered it again assuming that I will receive a good quality product. However post month the new earphone that I received stopped functioning.I had to visit the Service center and get it replaced.Not expected such type of product from Amazon
",negative
"Using for 6 months. No problems as of now. Satisfied with the build quality (rough use). Microphone is crisp and clear. You can't expect a better all rounder sound quality at this price. Best suited for EDM, pop, rap etc. If you prefer Classical, and clarity over bass, I'd suggest to go with a higher end audio technica over Sennheiser. Ciao!
",positive
"Received delivery of the earphone 1 hour ago.Guys I can't stop listining to my playlists now.Previously I owned Skull candy smokin buds 2.This is way better than 👆.Sound quality further increases after a week or few days of usage.Can't wait to experience the final results.Paisa pura wasool.Will update after a month or so😎

"I have been using this product since 2 years and I was very much satisfied and I bought this again and I am still satisfied with it.I will definitely suggest this product because its worth every single penny you spend on it.It has a long duration and the best part is the sound,its just amazing.The quality is also good.I would just say,just go for it.

"This is amazing product from Sennheiser. I am using it from last one year sound qualities of this headphone is superb, before a cell phone find using Sennheiser CX 180 Street II compare to that best headphone quality is Good and it comes with mic

"It didn't last even for 2 month. I was very disappointed with the product as it stopped working suddenly despite good maintenance. I  always use Sennheiser's headphones. I think the product that I received is a duplicate one
",negative
"Recieved this just now.Its nice and all but the small L-shaped connector they gave in the box is not working properly.When connected through l shaped connector the sound is only coming in one earbud and not the other but when connected directly the sound is available in both so i don't know whether i should ask for a replacement or just ignore that l shaped connector.

"One of the best in ear headphones available in the market. The name is Sennheiser and it symbolises Quality Audio. As a general music lover, all I can say is it is awesome. Coreectly produces all the ranges of sound spectrum. Though it doesn't has very high bass but it is balanced.Music comes out crystal clear and it doesn't pain in the ear after long duration of listening music.
",positive
"Well I'm not gonna describe them in detail. Get the thing cleared that, product delivered is genuine and is awesome. All layers of song are clearly audible, whether you listen to EDMs or Rock or Pop. They won't dissapoint you. You'll know what the real bass is when you'll use these earphones. Pause/Play and Previous/Next track option is also supported. Pouch is handy. Quality is great.To test any earphones, for bass listen to ""G6, Lil John- Bass terror, Bassnector- Empathy"", For Bass+Treble "" Skrillex -Kill everybody vs Ruffneck"", for filtering ""Adventure Club - Kaboom, Bloodletting""  ... In price range of 2K, only these earphones will not dissapoint you. I'm in love with them.

"Best earphones ever & even Sony, JBL, Skullcandy etc can't even match or compared with Sennheiser brand  overall performance is great but which one is right and left note mentioned on earphones dat not a problem & with Dolby Atmos sounds great 👌👍

"Initially performance was good. But one ear piece stopped working within 15 months of use ! Its too early to break down such an expensive ear phone from a reputed brand...not expected at all.
",negative
"I thought the 'senheiser' name was enough but utterly disappointed afer using it. I don't know if i received a used product or what but the music quality was extremely poor. My apple earbuds, even my moto earphones are far more better. Never gonna trust a brand again without using it first.
",negative
"Highly satisfied from the bass, sound quality and noise cancellation. Design is too good and impressive. Its not getting tangled. I am recommending go for it dont think twice. I did same day delivery and i got it within 16hrs of ordering... For this earphone just one word- WOWW..
",positive
"CX 180 is far better than CX 275s. First of all CX 275 is not fit well in ear and Mic quality is also very poor for which Amazon charging  at list Rs. 900 Extra. You can buy twice CX 180 in the price of CX 275 and also save some money. CX275 has very thin wire that sound very cheap. I recommend not to Buy CX275s.
",negative
"These are good ear phones. But to be honest, I wouldn't say that these are way better than Apple EarPods. EarPods has its own classy features to this. At the same time, this earphones have very good noise attenuation features really. I have got these for around ₹1513, which is a very good deal and they are worth the bucks I have shelled out.
",positive
"Wow! Just wow. Haven’t used any earphones that fit in my ears better than these ones. Sound good, everything good. For me, the fit has been the biggest challenge always and these win hands down.

"In the name of noise cancellation it it just a freek. It just fits good in ears doesn't cansel noise. Wire should have been made of better quality to avoid tangelling. In the price range that it is being sold.

"Sennheiser service is great....I bought this product in July 2016 but unfortunately, it got damaged due to a manufacturing defect. I contacted customer service through the toll-free number. They said to courier the product with the bill to Bangalore as it the only nearest service center to me (Chennai). I couriered it as they informed and within 5 days I got a new Sennheiser CX 275 S. THANKS, alot Sennheiser.

"The sound quality is very nice. The material is also good, have just started using it, so have to see after an year, the build quality. Would update the review again then.

"Noise reduction ?---------- A BIG YES. @ 1300 bucks in 'Amazon lightning deals' which would otherwise be 2000 bucks at any other website, it was definitely a steal. 100% loud applause for Amazon for making this real.Product:- Thumping basses + sizzling trebles.....nothing much out of proportion or distorted. I am not a technical buff nor have I done any course in musicology but I have had at least a dozen headsets from various makers in the past  and can assure that this thing is a beast. Again, don't always blame the hardware. The same song at 96 kbps and 320 kbps sound different through the same gadget. I cannot afford a Bose but this thing is definitely way better than my native Samsung/Nokia headsets.
",positive
"I have been using this for almost 2 years now. I have tried so many earphones on the last 10 years.... But none come even close to the quality you get with this one. Exceptional clarity and superb responsive in both low and high frequencies.Each time you put it on, you can feel the difference.
",positive
"Overall pretty good.Complete noise cancellation is not expected at this price range anyway. But it does reduce some background noise.Earbubs fit quite well. Would not fall off during workout. Build quality is also very nice.Sound quality is very good at this price range although it lacks the punchy bass that some prefer.
",positive
"This item has been quite good. I have tried JBL, House of Marley, Sony and Philips earphones, but this one leaves all competition behind. But of late, I am facing problems with the product. One side of the earphone is not working. Since the product is still in the warranty period, I would like to know how to get this repaired/replaced. There is no email ID/contact detail of Cloudtail India Private Limited.

"This product is amazing. The Sound quality just awesome full balanced vocal, tune, bass, treble all such things are fully balanced. HIGH LOW MID level all are just fabulous you can hear all sounds in a track. But the build quality compared to this price range it should be better than other product.
",positive
"As usual the Sennheiser rocks. Tried throwing different genre and it surpasses my expectation in all. After a lot of confusion between sony xb series and sennheiser cx series, I decided to go for sennheiser. This can become a perfect travel buddy cancelling all the surrounding noise.The package comes with steps to authenticate your earphone on official website. It is genuine. I also contacted sennheiser customer care just to do another round of review and they also confirmed the authenticity.I am deducting a star because the cable is very thin and you need to take extra care of this product to avoid cable damage (just my thought). It is also compatible with lumia, xperia, moto and iPhone.Again, its an amazing earphone below 2K.

"First the quality of bass and treble it produces is very good. Perfectly fits in the ear.Pros:-1) Excellent Bass2)Crystal Clear sound3)Outstanding Noise Cancelletion4)Great mic quality5)Inclusion of Pouch is good6)2 years warranty is like icing on the cakeCon:-The only con is that the cable quality.

To say about the product, awesome product for this awesome price. I got it just for 1364 bucks, which is nothing when compared to the quality of the sound and other features. The ear phone gels well with Ipod and other apple products when compared to other Android devices.

"Awesome sound quality! I love it :-)The box contains my CX275s, two extra earbuds (one large, one small pair), carry pouch.I just listened one song on this, would update more later.EDIT: They worked for 2 years straight on. This is really good. I purchased on 29 Aug 2015 and only around Oct 2017 it started having issues with one earphone not giving sound. It cost me Rs.1791 for 2 years, that is Rs. 2.4875 per day. Any other Rs. 500 earphone would have started giving issues in 6 months which would be costlier. The sound quality is really good. I am not a bass-head, I don't want my eaphones to boom base. I like music, and these are perfect. They don't focus on base. These earphones got pulled on many times, when I thought these would be done. They got twisted. It suffered through all that and didn't stop working. So it's durable.

"Sennheiser has the best warranty in the market, they even replace the physically damaged piece in just five minutes(only bill is required). Best sound quality is complemented by the amazing warranty(just they have only service centers in Delhi and Mumbai in India.). Go for it,best value for money. Writing this review after using these earphones for 2 years.

"Select the cushions right and you are in for a treat. I ordered one and found the bass flat in contrary to the reviews -  I returned it - Since its Amazon fulfilled - it was hassle free - Ordered an another one as I highly trust Sennheiser products and thought the 1st one was a manufacturing defect - Got the second one and found the bass to be meh however this time I opened the entire package and switched to the largest cushion which instantly transformed the entire experience, you instantly switch to a club experience...

"AWESOMMMMMMEEEEEBought this from Cloudtail, Good quality and fast delivery. Coming to the Headphones, These are Bassy. One of the best pairs I own till date. I have owned Sony, Samsung, HTC, Lenovo, Beats and my previous best earphones the MI Pistons 2.I used to think the Piston had some good Bass and clarity but after hearing the Sennheiser cx275s, Am just in Aw. And the best part is that the performance is out of the box, The headphones will get better with play.You can hear individual bass beats and it sounds nice. Also the Mids are good(Not best but still pretty nice). Highs are also pretty nice.ONLY CON:The Wires seem very Fragile. Too thin.Mic seems ok quality. But You buy these cx for their sound quality so who cares about the mic
",positive
"Weak cables. Looks and feels delicate. Build quality is not worth the $$. The mic on this one died within two months of use. Disappointed as i expected that it would last me for 6 months for the least. Audio is decent although you can find better for half it's price.

"The Sennheiser CX275 S is an excellent earphone with very good sound quality. The brand is doing a justice for the sound clarity and the bass of any song provided. The only cons is that the wire quality is not so very strong and seems tangle very much which makes it quite delicate to handle when kept inside the pocket. Since it is priced higher, the quality of the wire can be changed.Otherwise, the earphones is a good buy.

"Good bass though not top notch but at this price point it can't get better than this i suppose. Sound quality at high and lows are good and there is no distortion. The carrying case provided with it is a nice. I got it for 1500 and it's worth the money.

"I am just loving listening Sennheiser CX 275. Every instruments of music/song is clear and distinct, base is there and it is as it should be, enough to enjoy without feeling hurt. It has proper and clear treble. lows, mid and high are all clear, constant and smooth. Base is beautiful as it should be or as has been recorded in the studio and does not loose even on high. I am enjoying listening at every level of volume. Under Rs. 2000/-, the best bye !

"I have a collection of various headphones, but must say that this is ths the best headphone atleast in sub 2k price range.I regularly listen music in my Moto G 1st gen, and I am quite serious about audio quality of the phone and the headsets. I, may not be an audiophile but can assure that this excellent headphone have the most balanced, precise audio output capabilities.Headsets I have used-1) sony mdr ex 30 - too bass heavy, audio not clear, bulky2) Creative ep630 - less bass, short wire, less warm sound3) Nokia wh205 - very good audio output, slightly bassy, not crystal clear sound as sennheiser, wire don't tangles.4) Cowon em1 - at par with Nokia wh205. Slightly midtone heavy5) soundmagic es18s - just bought  cannot beat sennheiser, but 2nd best, good balance, not very loud, good cable, but gets tangled.6) sennheiser cx 275-Pros- good balance between bass and treble, lows are clear and crisp, quite loud, very comfortable, excellent noise isolation, nice bagCons- slightly excess treble, mids not perfect, wires get tangled, cables are thin.There is hardly any headphone without any limitations, still I must say that this item satisfied my needs more than enough. I will purchase another one.

"So-So..... I was using xperia stock Mh750 ACIA  in ear that comes with Z2. Mh750 has a deeper bass. And I have sony mdr30 as well, although mdr30 suppress everything due to extra bass and it's not good but it has a mild treble which sooth my ear. Anyway its upto people what they like.Edit 2: after 5hr burn, bass feels good, but treble is a bit harsh still.

"I was confused between Sony MDR xb30ex and these earphones. But I was getting Sennheiser at Rs.1300  in sale so I ordered them.Looks : they look niceBuild quality:the wire is very thin but not  fragile.Still you have to be careful.Sound: with EDM songs you are doing in another world . For hip hop the base is just as much needed.They actually sound beautiful with every genre.Lastly let me say under Rs.2000 buying these pair will be your best decision.And for price I got Rs.1300 I think I cannot be more lucky to own them.

"The CX275s is a really market worthy earphone. The bass is amazing, you can clearly feel the pounding of the beats. The vocals is crisp and clear and does not interfere with any other sounds. Movies, songs, games, calls, radio all sound amazing.The noise cancellation is pretty amazing. I have had trouble with in-ear pieces on the Apple or Sony headsets, but this one fits extremely well. People now tap me to draw my attention, it's that good. The build looks fragile but is actually very sturdy.I got this product at a lightning deal during #FreedomSale and the product arrived on time, so no complaints with Amazon's delivery. However, the 3.5 mm connector that is provided with the box is a defective one.

"Sound and bass are everything goods , but this is failure model , after 6 month's the product is damaged , the earphones are not working ( i.e jack ) ,then service center replaced my item without any issues .Finally music wise sounds good , but hardly it is 6 month's only work. Bette to go for one more model in senheiser

"Disgraceful, my family is buying the seinheiser’s earplugs since last 5years, it always been a more than satifaction experience with the product, but this is the degradation of its product (275s)..Never expected that seinheiser will compromise its quality.. BOAT earphone option might have been a better one..  :/

"The headphones are simply amazing considering the price of the product.Pros: The highs/ mids/ lows are all very clear. Each instrument and music effect sounds pretty amazing. Bass is very impressive. In my OnePlus One device i dont even need to use Audio FX to boost any of the original sounds in a song. Havent tried taking calls yet but m sure it will be good. Noice reduction is pretty amazing even on low volumes.Cons:To get perfect sound effects you need to raise the volume upto 30 %. The build quality seems to be flimsy, but am sure the 2 years warranty will take care of that. Could have also added volume controls with mic and remote button for taking calls.

"I bought this product in Aug 2016 , I must say the sound quality is awesome but the built quality of the product is at very low level. I have replaced this product under warranty 4 times in last 2 years. Now as warranty is over the 4 th replacement also not working now. As you can see in pictures i have submitted wires from the tip of the pin start getting damaged within span of 1 or 2 months.

"Best earphone for hearing music but not that good for playing movies.  Noise cancellation is good.I think price of product is hyped it should be between 900 to 1000rs.New update on reviewI had bought the earphone on 25th June 2017 and after 9 months of using it sound quality has dropped very low. Can barely hear in full volume. Going to courier it in service center. What a Drag!!!

"The best Headset in low range for pure music listening.  I earlier had a Sony regular headset which was complete in itself.  The Beats and Bass of that one were better than any headset I have encountered.But after listening through this it took me to a whole new level of musical approach. The Beats and music detail are so clear that even at lowest volume you can feel every single beat.The Headset fitting in ears is awesome. You can listen to the songs for hours without hurting your ears.The Noise reduction is perfect as even at low volumes you can experience all the fun.TheBut be cautious as it is not for persons who love Boombox type music.  The Overall bass is good but it isn't made for Bass based music. So if you want Bass go with Sony or Jbl but if you want beats,  obviously this is the One.I am writing this review after 6 months of purchase and have not encountered a single problem with the product.

"do not estimate the quality before 50 hours of burning. after 50 hours it pours honey in your ears. i promise. its bass and reverb makes you feel in heaven. if you are audiophile and bass head , get a good music play app and set equalizers for your taste. you are done. no back looking.

"I was really skeptical when buying these as I have never used sennheisers before , was really torn between these and Sony xb30 series but decided to go for these as the Sony ones felt a bit uncomfortable and too bass heavy .First of all build quality is pretty good .9/10Excellent noise cancelation was able to hear to everything clearly even while driving at 100km/h on my bike . 10/10Sound is very well balanced ,decent bass ,decent treble got almost everything I expected from thesePeople who listen to edm  will love these ,heavy metal listeners maybe a bit disappointed.All in all these headphones are great and 2 years warranty is the cherry on the top.

"It's a very good product. Sennheiser always delivers a superior studio quality sound, nevertheless the headphone is noise-free or not. This product is a complete noise-free one, no noise from even besides you can interfere between your music moments. The quality of the sound is, as I've said, studio-quality. You can feel the sound waves grooving inside your head, if the music you're listening to is intended to be felt so, I mean, that is possible with this product. And the carrying pouch is nice, by the way.The only con, you can't hear what your friend is telling you sitting beside you.
",positive
"Best in its pricing categories! The sound cancellation is so good, can't hear a single thing from the environment when the music is on. The microphone is so sensitive that it catches unwanted sounds from the environment while on call. But, that's okay. Overall a good purchase!

"Sennheiser has been a reliable brand ever since I started listening to music. For anyone looking for a good earpiece with a mic, this masterpiece is bang on.Bass lovers may not like it as much, but if you're looking for details and practicality, CX 275S is what you would love at this price point.No sound distortion even at peak levels.Love this piece of engineering. <3

"Don't like the bass in this, within one day it stopped working, sound is blaring, not even as to use for calls, sound quality is pathetic in laptop and in phone, there's no bass quality, only blaring torn speaker noise comes, the worst earphones I have ever used in my entire life!!! DONT BUY

"Serves the purpose. Wanted something which is an all rounder and the CX275 s fits the bill perfectly. Call clarity is good and the mic does its job well. For prolonged usage, i suggest changing the in ear buds to the smaller one (different sized buds come along with this model) as the ones from factory were slightly bigger than required for me.

"absolutely love this pair of ear buds. i needed something for my casual listening purpose while travelling, being on a budget these provided a great solution to that. at 1425 i couldn't have asked for a better deal. the best part is they are balanced, unlike most headphones on the market today that are just infused with meaningless bass. Don't get me wrong, these deliver amazing bass as well, but it's all controlled and the way it's supposed to be. amazing sound spectrum and clarity. anything for casual listening and beyond, go for it!

"Decent earphones. Worth the price.1. Call cut button works just fine2. The same button, double tap to move to next track while listening to songs.3. Triple tap to move back to the previous track doesn't work. This worked with my Sony stock earphones.4. Sound quality is good.Although these features don't work when u use the extension that comes along with this. I'm not sure why the extension is required.If you are looking for a decent set of earphones this one is the right one for you. If u are an ardent listener and a music fanatic there may be other better options out there for you.

"Well, I have used a lot many earphones over the years starting from Philips, Sony to Skullcandy etc etc of multiple ranges, be it below 500 or above 1500. But this particular product from Sennheiser has just upped my listening to music experience by miles. Simply one of the best of this range, and as an overall product also beats Sony and Skullcandy at its range. The music, the beats, the overall everything associated with a particular song feels even more vibrant now. I would suggest everyone and anyone looking forward to a decent earphone....go for this one. Absolutely worth it.

"Built quality is pretty poor... But sound quality is best in this range... Not for bass lovers... It has v shape sound signature so it will have pure sound... I used it for 2 years... & Again after a long search for a upgrade I cannot find the better earphone so bought these...

"Let me be very honest, I ordered the product on Saturday night around 8:15 PM or so and received next day by 2:30 PM. The earphones are mind-blowingly amazing, far better than many headsets available at 2k-4k. Sennheiser did an amazing job with each and every bit of the headsets. The ear cushions are very soft therefore you can wear those for many hours, coming to the sound quality the bass output is top notch. I recommend without giving a second thought go and buy it now!!!

"If you're a Bass freak like me then you'll definitely love this. I'm using it with my oneplus one and definitely having a great time listening to GnR, Metallica, AC-DC, John Mayor, Keith Urban, Fossils, The Missing Link, Fakira etc. (not a Bollywood fan at all). Noise cancellation is very good. Anyways, the build is fragile though. It looks awesome. The leather pouch comes along is a life  saver. It takes calls and does it efficiently. Much better than many expensive butt caps available in the market today. Recommended to everyone. Thank me later.

"I have 3 different earphones of Sennheiser, CX180 Street II, CX275 & Now CX2.00G,Sennheiser has excellent build quality and of course no doubt about its sound, it has balanced bass with clear treble.

"One of the best earbuds for this price!! The clarity is amazing, the bass is good. What more can you ask for! The only negative I feel is that the wires could have been a little thicker and sturdier..not that it will snap just like that..but still!! An excellent buy!!

"I have been using this product for a year now. This is one of the best earphones I have used. Sould quality is very good. If not handled properly, the wires can get entangled. The material quality looks good and the product looks durable

"Wanted a nice earphone with mic. After searching for days , finally decided to buy this.As, till now its been only 2 weeks and experiecne is fine. Cost with mic is a bit high , more than double , as without mic price was 700 approx.Overall sound quality : awesome ( i previously had samsung earphone and sennisser headphone, hence comparing it form my previous earphone)

"I own this one & sony xb55ap.Sound quality & base are excellent.Plus point over xb55ap is it's comfortable fit.very lightweight & you can use it for longer time without any problem.Build quality can be improved.Go for it, if you are not a rough user

"The Sennheiser CX 275 S has a straightforward design. The rubber buds are soft and comfy to wear. It has noise cancellation feature which is pretty good and a minimal design. It has a good bass and treble range. Overall sound clarity is above average and it is tailored for a bass heavy experience. If you require a fair clarity and awesome bass featured headpiece, definitely go for it.
",positive
"Really good earbuds. What i like more about these is the directional separation of different sounds which is really good for immersion. And bass is okay too.. And these get really loud. At the maximum sound there is apparent distortion but trust me you aren't going to get volume that high since is really loud..

"I have used a lot of ear pods beats, Sony , Jbl etcBut this is the best I personally feel coz if someone a bass lover and clarity this one's the ultimate. Its tiny but when you push em in ur ears it blocks outside world and then it begins. The microphone is also very clear.Con: The microphone dsnt have a noise cancellation
",positive
"The headset Quality is good. Amazon delivery is also good. Rating wise 3star for headset and +1 star for fast delivery. Sound quality is good but not a worth for 1791/- Rs .. People if u need a headset just to hear music , then you can go for Senheiser street ll.. Both are having the almost 95% same sound quality. But if u need a headset with mic then u can go for this option .. Rest is all fine with this headset!!! Hope this review help someone

"Purchased from cloud tail.(authorised seller for sennheiser in amazon).Very Very fast delivery.One of the best ear phones with mic. if microphone is not required then should definitely consider other options such as  CX 180 produces the same sound quality with some less Bass and sony mdr-xb30EX with heavy Bass.Pros  Very good sound quality.  Micro phone  Bass is very good (Thumps after 10 - 15 hr usage)  2 years warranty (no brand dare to give it.)  Leather Case.Cons  Build quality is low no tangle free cable.  Price must be little bit less (very high more than twice that of CX 180 which has better build quality)
",positive
"Sound quality amazing. I listened sounds boat , Sony, scullcandy , JBL, prices about 4000/- , it's sound quality  equal to these brands. Clarity is amazing. Even I bought 1more triple driver . Cx275s sounds quality is better than 1more. Reviewing after 6 months.

"I received the earphones within a day thanks to amazing Amazon delivery. I have used the headphones for 2-3 days and I am very impressed by its sound. Sennheiser never disappoints when it comes to sound, I have another model MX-170 and I have been using it for last 5 years and it still gives that good sound as ever. This has got a more than average bass to it, and the sound clarity and all sounds which are overpowered by bass can be heard. Mic also a big advantage, and its fits into the ear perfectly , no chance of falling out. There are multiple options depending upon ear size. The only bad thing is that it gets tangled very easily, and becomes a hassle to untangle.

"I just received these bad boys today let me tell u this by far these r the best pair I ever had I have used jbl Sony skull candy creative sound magic audio technicia but these headphones r where I stop its just going to be these here on.Crystal clear sound n those u love a good bass effect than man there r ur thingI ordered them yesterday n I received them today by far the best in the price range just close ur eyes n go for it 👍

"The headset is awesome and when it's worn, you are isolated from the world.Only limitation is that the wires are not having any protection but I have been using it about a month rough it's able to withstand.The 3.5 mm jack seems to be wearing out the gold plating earlier than expected, I have to adjust the plug to get sound in both ear pieces other one works for all the time unadjusted.

"Simply a value for money.Sound quality is excellent in this price range. Balanced sound... Doesn't feel like lowering of vocal during bass... Simply awesome... A must buy in 1700 price. Recommended for anyone who wants balnced sound nd bass is not that high as in sony in-ear earphones but it is a earphone for all the daily users. Wire quality looks a little bit fragile nd weak bt its not. Noise cancelling is awesome.. Blocks almost all sound from outside.

"Hands down to this brand. This is one hell of a earphones I'll ever own. Starting from the package to the material quality to the sound quality nothing could have been more perfect than this. Every penny was worth it! Thankyou so much Sennheiser for producing such quality products and setting a benchmark!
",positive
"it's really good. But jbl t150 a gives almost same quality at considerably lower price (this one is slightly better though). So if u are looking for value for money go for jbl t150a (available at 899 when I ordered this ) or else this is fabulous.. Specially the ear buds are super comfortable (much more comfortable than jbl ones). The wire is a little thin but sturdy. The material looks a bit sticky. Better keep it carefully if you don't plan  use  it for a long time. (one of my older Nokia headset suffered from that. Got tangled and rubber melted and ultimately unusable).But in short if you are looking for a good earphone with mic in mid range budget this is a solid option.

"I'm writing this review after 3 months of purchase.Sound quality is awesome. Ear buds hold the position very well. Length of the cable is very convenient. The pouch and the box look trendy and the extra pairs of ear buds provide extra fitting options. But one less star for the cable which needs to be handled with utmost care to avoid tear.

Noise cancellation is good but not the 100% noise cancellation. When im in skype call, i do hear every other noise as well apart from the person voice!!! But really good product. Im loving it.. Hearing the Music in this head phone is really a very good experience. And more over 2 years warranty i bet no one would provide for this cost.And if anything ever happens to your ear phone there will be replacement with the entire new one from the company itself(as 2 years Warranty period), which till now i haven't seen from any other company would do.

"When i was looking for an ear phone with call facility, every one was suggesting samsung and other brands. At max they suggested to go for sony.I had an experience of Sennheiser CX 180 and they were far better for listening training video than Creative ep 630.I thought to give it a try and luckily i was successful. These ear phones are made to listen voice calls and perfect in listening music as well.Guess what after me, two of my friends also bought the same ear phone for them.Truly worthy for their features and their price, oops i forgot  - you get two years warranty replacement

"Most worthy in ear head phones. I am too glad to have them. Although, i was not happy with the delivery boy, as I ordered the headphones at my office address expecting it to be delivered on Weekdays, but it reached on Sunday and delivery boy didn't agree to delivery it at my house lying in a radius of 500m. Taking about headphones - the sound quality is best. Even  while driving on a busy road, a volume level of 40 is enough to give crystal clear sound with bass. For some, the price seems out of budget but trust me - tje quality is much more than expectations.

"Only trained ear can experience the Clarity of sound. Initially you may not find any significant difference between a standard earphone which u get from Samsung or Nokia brand.  After ""burn in"" for a while then u ll definitely notice highly enhanced  BASS driven sound.  I was skeptical before buying this but now i don't regret at all.  The design is intuitive. wire may look fragile but believe me they are sturdy.  I hope it lasts long.  5 star for the Product but i have given 4 because of the extended time for delivery.  i paid extra 50 rupees for fast delivery but they took one day extra.

"Sennheiser CX275 s ear phones are not that much responsive. I have used Creative EP 630, it sounds better than these. Even I've used Sony MDR-EX220 but they are also not clear;  base is good but crispness absent. I will suggest creative.I must say dont' go for this expensive earphone, even the the company name-Sennheiser is not giving justice to quality of sound. Even half price other brand earphones are much better than this.One good suggestion, before purchasing any earphone, first use it.Ask some one who is using it to give you for trying.(don't feel hesitant, its your question of satisfaction, better be known before than crying afterward )Try it and when you are satisfied with the sound  then only purchase it.

"Very good earpiece. Well i have used many but this one has higher volume with respect to others and quality is also good.  The earpiece cover or pouch that comes with it is really helpful, this prevents it from tangling to itself.

"Its good. Not Awesome. I own CX180 already and I was happy with the sound quality of it.I bought this just because it is having mic support with smartphones.Pros: Good Sound Quality as always from Senheiser, Mic recording is beautiful, extension given and the pouch is given good enough to carry in your bag/purse.Cons:Not a tangle free wire, While placing the earphone in the ear we need to hold it at the tip. there is no kind of covering layer given at the joint of ear bud and wire connecting it so that we can hold it while placing it. (CX180 has a proper layer which gives enough support) , I would not recommend this while you have your helmets on the bike. A BIG NO NO. for those who are purchasing this for daily bike travel. as this tends to tangle alot and the fear is that without the holder i mentioned above it might cut it from the tip.
",positive
"Nice clarity,  loud sound,  good sounf effect.  However i feel bass is not so good especially on iphones.  Also,  if i keep mic near to my mouth other person can here me breathing on call n if i keep normal they can't here.  Overall net net its a good buy.

"the headphones worked for a year without a glitch, but almost a year later, the console became gummy and sticky, I used these headphones only while traveling in public transits(bus). The console cover got completely spoiled and came off the headphones totally leaving the inner circuit open, after that within a day or two headphones died completely. Now they are just a piece of dead garbage, doesn't even charge or get turned on.Skull candy provides 2 years warranty all across the world except India.WOW.... it's just a year of warranty u get in India and upon calling they told me that Skullcandy headphones cant be fixed in any other way and I have to buy a new one. This wasn't expected from Skullcandy, I am hugely disappointed with the product, my 3700 bucks are wasted. I would recommend not to purchase this garbage as it works only for a year.

"The controls stopped working within 3 months of use!!!!  After using for 10 minutes, they get disconnected automatically and the you have to charge them again to use and have to connect to a power supply to switch on the earbuds!!!!!  Bad quality.

Even my Skullcandy Method stopped working but a bit later after using it for 10 months. Got a replacement but they too have stopped working after 15 days of use!!!!!Do not buy Skullcandy earphones, better buy Sennheiser Momentum wired for Rs. 4.5-5K.  Quality is much better.

"Very poor quality of sound - almost sounds like a shriek on Iphones and equalizer setting aren't of much help. Very flat bass, Instead of this go for Skullcandy Ink'd.

"I purchased an SB2 wireless from a Skullcandy shop last year. For @ 6 months it worked well but one day it suddenly stopped working. It did not turn ON in spite of charging fully. I got a replacement as it was under warranty but the new piece also had the same issue after @ 6 months. As it was now out of warranty, I negotiated with the seller who gave me his display piece which again had the same issue within a couple of weeks. I tried various solutions available online to troubleshoot but it simply refuses to get switched on. This clearly proves that there is something fundamentally wrong with the product.I strongly advise against purchasing this product or rather any Skullcandy product for that matter.

"Listening to your neighbours blasting bhajan sangeet is a better wireless music experience than buying jbl. I hope God forgives these souls for making these earphones, because I know I can't. I am a JBL fan. I use a lot of their products like their sound bar, flip 4, wired earphones etc. They're all of wonderful quality and excellent durability. I saw that these didn't have a good rating on amazon, but still bought them because I trusted jbl. But as it turns out these are equivalent to cattle - excrement. I've never been so disappointed in something before. I absolutely hated the sound. I thought I'll give it another day and voila, the earphones have the craftsmenship of a toddler's craft from pottery class. The earpiece was coming apart, not to mention how difficult it was to keep them in my ear without falling. Don't buy it. You sure deserve better. I'd wish this whole experience only on the worst of my enemies.

"I purchased this product a month ago & before to complete its first month, one of the ear-bud stopped working .This was never expected from a brand like JBL !! Amazon return policy gets over within 10 days but then to search for JBL Service Center is a very painful task.JBL has a single Service Center in each city, so very bad 'After-Sale-Service' !! (if you are not lucky)Even after visiting the Service Center, you are asked to submit your defective product & to come-back after 15days to get your product !! (Till the time its time of frustration !!)If possible, please dont go for this Product. Sound quality is also not attractive...

"Didn't even last for a year.Durability is least.The right earpiece broke (Thanks to my nephew)If taken care with proper care might last for 2 years(max).We have two in our house.One had to be replaced again due to non functioning of one side.The other one is the one I'm reviewing.Sound quality was top notch though.Battery backup is decent with 4-5 hours of continuous playback.Charging to 100% takes more than an hour.Verdict- Don't buy this crap, spend some more rupees and get a better quality one.

"Got this in Jan 19 and worked very well with excellent excellent quality as expected from JBL. What was not expected is the product lasted just 50 days and all of sudden mic stopped working, - volume button turned hard and could not press. When I tried pressing it the cover flicked off.Contact JBl customer and they were polite enought to guide me to service centre. Reached service centre and surprisingly I was told that there was a physical damage. I told that top cover just flicked when I pressed the volume button little hard. The service centre guy and JBL call centre guys told that it is a use and throw product and under one year it is just replacable. Sincerely with damaged they cannot process the warranty. I think ,  Even a small damage, they will reject the warranty claim. I think they expect the consumer to keep the product intact for a year. Not buying and recommending this anymore

"Was a big fan of JBL untill i received this product. The sound was not upto the mark. the voice on calls was pathetic as the reciever was hearing loud noises other than my voice. Bass was not proper. better to go with a wired earphone instead of buying this. It was looking so big on neck and was not manageable for runs and workout. Immidiately ordered return and amazon took lot many days to first return it and i am stil waiting for my money to be processed so that i can order a different earphone.

"Third class product and can't contact JBL customer support through call or email. Headphones battery doesn't hould charging even after charging overnight and it drains in few minutes feels like Amazon is good at  selling cheap products nor JBL or Amazon is ready to take responsibility.

"This is my personal experience with this product.I own JBL stuff at home.. but this device just doesn't belong to that category! Weird. Really disappointed by the quality. The audio quality doesn't sound like a genuine JBL make.. with very cheap BASE and slightly HIGH TREBLE.. it's not a pleasant product to enjoy music with.. sounds like the Chinese made ₹150 earphones.. i bought this product once and had it returned.. but then there was no available option for a refund. The Customer service executive asked me to have the product replaced and check the product quality as the one i recieved might have been damaged for some reason. I agreed and after 3 days i received my product today and it's a NEW one but now i realise the product quality.. the problems i mentioned earlier still persist. There was no defects in the earlier one either.. And now i return it again and i see a refund option.. but then initially i used my VISA card to pay.. and now the refund would only credit into my Amazon Pay Balance and not my bank account. Amazon wants me to spend that money on buying products from Amazon itself n wouldn't refund it to me. Anyways that shouldn't matter me as im a frequent user of the Amazon Pay Balance. But who knows it might be a matter of fact to other people using Amazon out there. That's again pretty disappointing. Totally unsatisfied with the seller and the product.PS : I tried this product on the One Plus 5T, Samsung Galaxy S9+ and also on an iPhone 7+ and it was all the same.

"there is a serious pairing issues with this headset. I was facing this issue for quite some time that while talking on call headset pairing breaks with my phone. i have tried it with other phone as well thinking it could be a device specific intermittent issue but story remained unchanged. additionally, i have testify it another friend of mine who recently purchase it and he stamped on this issue.would want to return it but my returning duration is lapsed. I am stuck with this faulty piece. :(have bought on a higher price than Portronics (becuase of brand image, JBL) but regretting now. :( :(

"Terrible Bass. This product does not justify the name given to it. I bought a Portronics Por-766 Conch 204 along with this set, just as a spare, cost me some 400 or something which has a better output than the JBL. I wouldn't reccommend this product if you want to listen to music.I cannot believe I fell for this brand and model name like this. I wish I hadn't bought the product.

So no use of its portability.While my friend bought same product from a retail shop and his is working just fine.Amazon doesn't sells original products.I have now got a very negative insight for Amazon and will never recommend anyone to shop.

I do have the same JBL T110 model without Bluetooth which is 10times better so I opted for this but I dnt knw y this is very disgusting low class quality.Small starting series of JBL is much much better than this piece.Am very much interested in Bluetooth model but I am unable to convince with this low class sound output.Believe me such a worst quality sound u will feel very dissatisfied if u purchase.

"With so many fake JBL earphones doing rounds in the market, I decided to buy one from Harman, instead of Amazon. Original with all serial numbers.Trust me, to my sheer disbelief the audio quality was very poor. Crap. I asked for a replacement. After much ugly dialogues got it replaced after 2 months. A little bit of improvement in audio output. No bass. Squeezed sound. Throw your money into the sea, instead of buying this peice of s**t.
",negative
"Very bad Im very unsatisfied to it

"One of the worst product from jbl I have ever bought. The earphone stopped working in a month. Then took them to the service centre in nehru place  where in their customer register all the complaints were related to this product only. As far as the customer care service is concerned, it is way more worse than the product because Jbl take ages to replace your product as for mine they took 20 days for the replacement. Then again the new earphones stopped working within a month.So, as a genuine user of this product I would not recommend anyone to go for these earphones as it has some manufacturing defect within the device itself.
",negative
"I bought expensive tiny monster from Croma a year ago. In just one year and 6-7 days, one side of the earphone stopped working. worst part is yet to come. I expected at least a repair by paying a few bucks after surpassing 1 year warranty deadline at the authorized service centre which again is just one in whole gujarat state. But to my shock they denied repairing and when I called their customer care they justified it with all silly reasons for not repairing.  So in the end it is just a cheap use and throw pairs of earphone with over 2000 Rs. price tag.  JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS TINY MONSTER and go for any other cheaper brand.

"I am using this product for I had received it as a gift. The sound quality for calls is awful, the voice is truly smudged, and you need to conncentrate to understand. Nothing to offer much for music too. It has more of treble and less of Bass. The sound qualtiy doesn;t really matches the standard in the range of 2.1K. It is waste of money.The battery life too, isn't that great. 2 hours of charge and 6 hours of usage!!!No Google Assistant, no waterproof.The only plus are the design and the magnetic buds which keep them safe and less entangled.'v'

"After using sennhiser cx275s for four mnths, trust me guys these jbl earphones sound horrable, bought these cuz jbl said pure bass sound but its not, average bass high in vocals, not recomended for music lovers, i use them only for youtube or while playing any sport, thats it no more use than that, im totally unhappy with these pair jbl is fooling everyone.....😤

"hey guys. bought it. used it. has a bass boost apparently, but it doesn't seem bassy enough for some reason. my Samsung wired headphones were better on that aspect. plus if ure planning to use it for running, dont buy this. the wireless aspect is not helpful as the wires keep bouncing in front of your face. tooo cumbersome to keep pushing them away during runs.
